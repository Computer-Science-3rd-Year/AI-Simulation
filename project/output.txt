I'm not sure what's more impressive, the hotel's commitment to excellence or the fact that every single aspect of my stay was in "optimal maintenance conditions"! I've never seen a hotel take pride in their maintenance like this before.

The coffee machine in the lobby was sparkling clean, the room service equipment was spotless, and the ironing board in the room was polished to a shine. I mean, who expects to see an ironing board that's been recently cleaned and maintained? It's the little things that count, and the Melia Hotel is definitely paying attention to the little things.

But it wasn't just the behind-the-scenes stuff that impressed me. The pool table in the game room was in perfect working order, and the tennis courts were well-maintained and ready for action. I even caught a show in the hotel's theater, and the sound and lighting systems were in top condition.

What really sets the Melia Hotel apart, however, is their commitment to excellence. It's clear that the staff takes pride in their work and is dedicated to ensuring that every guest has an exceptional experience.

However, my experience was not without its flaws. The restaurant, while offering a wide range of options, was in need of a bit of a refresh. The decor was a bit dated and the service was slow at times. I ordered a simple meal, but it took a while to arrive and the presentation was not impressive.

Additionally, I was looking forward to the evening show, but unfortunately, it was not up to par. The sound system was not working properly and the performers seemed a bit disorganized. It was clear that they were trying their best, but it just didn't come together.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to travelers who are looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. However, I would caution them to be aware of the potential issues with the restaurant and evening entertainment.

**Pros:**

* Clean and well-maintained room
* Comfortable bed and bathroom
* Convenient location

**Cons:**

* Restaurant needs a refresh
* Evening show was disappointing
* Service was slow at times

**Rating:** 3.5/5 stars

**Recommendation:** If you're looking for a good night's sleep and a convenient location, the Melia Hotel is a good choice. However, if you're looking for a top-notch dining experience or evening entertainment, you may want to consider other options.

REVIEW --> **3.5/5 stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience. The hotel's location was convenient and the staff were friendly and welcoming.

However, there were a few areas that fell short of my expectations. The coffee machine in the lobby was in need of some maintenance - it was out of order for most of my stay, which was a bit of a disappointment.

On the other hand, the ranchon (pool area) was in excellent condition and a great place to relax and soak up some sun. The pool was clean and well-maintained, and the surrounding area was tidy and well-organized.

I also had some issues with the gym, which was in need of a bit of maintenance. The equipment was old and some of it was out of order, which made it difficult to get a good workout.

One area where the hotel truly excelled was with their transfer service. The driver was waiting for me at the airport and was very helpful in getting me to the hotel. The transfer was smooth and efficient, and I was impressed with the level of service.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but with the caveat that they may want to address some of the maintenance issues in the coffee machine and gym areas.

**Pros:**

* Convenient location
* Friendly staff
* Excellent transfer service
* Well-maintained ranchon

**Cons:**

* Coffee machine in need of maintenance
* Gym in need of maintenance
* Some equipment out of order

**Rating:** 3.5/5 stars

But what really stood out to me was the pool table. I know it sounds like a small thing, but it's a great touch to have a well-maintained pool table in the hotel's game room. It added a fun and relaxed atmosphere to my stay, and I enjoyed spending some time playing a few games with my family.

REVIEW --> I think there may be a bit of a problem with this review!

While I appreciate the enthusiasm, it seems like you've repeated the same sentence about the pool table three times. I'm assuming you meant to say that the pool table was in good condition, but it's a bit confusing as it stands.

Here's a rewritten review that captures the essence of your original message:

"I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and was impressed with the cleanliness and maintenance of the facilities. The coffee machine was always well-stocked and in good working order, and the ranchon (I assume you mean the restaurant?) served delicious meals. The pool table was also in great condition, making it a great spot to relax and have some fun. Overall, I was very pleased with my stay at the Melia Hotel and would definitely recommend it to others."

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars - A Fantastic Stay at the Melia Hotel!**

I'm not sure what's going on here, but it seems like the Melia Hotel has a very... unique way of describing their amenities. I'm going to assume that "optimal maintenance conditions" is a fancy way of saying "they're all in great shape and working properly".

In any case, I was thoroughly impressed with my stay at the Melia Hotel. The energy drink vending machine was always stocked and functioning, which was a lifesaver on those early morning wake-up calls. The ranchon (I'm assuming that's a type of restaurant or bar?) had a great selection of food and drinks, and the staff were always friendly and attentive.

The show time (I'm guessing this refers to the hotel's entertainment options?) was top-notch, with a great lineup of events and activities to keep me entertained. And the hair salon? Absolutely fantastic! I got a great haircut and the staff were super friendly and knowledgeable.

But what really impressed me was the tennis facilities. The courts were well-maintained and the equipment was in great condition. I had a blast playing a few rounds with my friends and family.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a great place to stay. The staff were friendly, the amenities were top-notch, and the location was perfect. Can't wait to come back and experience it all again!

**Tips for future guests:**

* Make sure to check out the energy drink vending machine - it's a game-changer!
* The ranchon has a great happy hour deal, so be sure to take advantage of it.
* Don't miss out on the show time - it's a great way to unwind after a long day.
* The hair salon is a must-visit - the staff are amazing and the prices are super reasonable.
* And of course, be sure to hit the tennis courts - they're a blast!

I'm not sure where to start with my review of the Melia Hotel, but I'll try to summarize my experience in a few key points. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the hotel's attention to detail and commitment to excellence.

The coffee in the lobby was always freshly brewed and served in spotless cups, a great way to start the day. The room service was equally impressive, with prompt delivery and a wide range of options to suit every taste. I was particularly pleased to find that the table tennis equipment was in perfect working order, allowing me to enjoy a fun game with friends in the hotel's recreation area.

But what really stood out was the laundry service. I had a few items that needed washing, and the hotel's staff took care of them with lightning speed and precision. My clothes were returned to me clean, pressed, and smelling fresh - a true testament to the hotel's dedication to customer satisfaction.

And then there was the show time. I'm not sure what kind of entertainment the hotel typically offers, but I was treated to a spectacular display of... well, I'm not entirely sure what it was, but it was certainly impressive! Let's just say that the hotel's events team knows how to put on a show.

REVIEW --> I think there may be a bit of a problem with your review!

While it's great to hear that the various facilities and services at the Melia Hotel were in optimal maintenance conditions, it seems like you've repeated the same phrase about 10 times. I'm not sure if you meant to say that every single one of those amenities was in good working order, or if you just got a bit carried away with the phrase.

If I were to rewrite your review to make it more helpful and informative for other travelers, I might say something like:

"I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and was impressed with the cleanliness and maintenance of the facilities. The snack bar was well-stocked and convenient, and the laundry service was efficient and reliable. I also enjoyed the hotel's recreational activities, including the pool table, tennis courts, and gym. The table tennis area was a fun surprise, and I appreciated the opportunity to stay active during my stay.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a decent experience overall. The hotel's facilities were well-maintained, with the energy drink vending machine and snack bar being in excellent condition. I was able to grab a quick energy boost and a snack whenever I needed it, which was convenient.

However, the evening entertainment was a different story. The show time, which I assume was a live performance or event, seemed to be in need of a bit of maintenance. The timing was off, and the overall production felt a bit disjointed. I'm not sure if it was a one-time issue or a recurring problem, but it detracted from my overall experience.

The hotel's rooms were clean and comfortable, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The location was also convenient, with plenty of nearby restaurants and attractions.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but with the caveat that the evening entertainment could use some improvement.

**Pros:**

* Well-maintained facilities
* Convenient location
* Friendly staff

**Cons:**

* Evening entertainment needs improvement
* Show time was a bit of a letdown

**Recommendation:**

If you're looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay, the Melia Hotel is a good choice. Just be aware that the evening entertainment may not be up to par.

I was also able to enjoy some downtime at the hotel's steam room, which was clean and well-maintained. The pool area was another highlight, with comfortable lounge chairs and a refreshing pool to cool off in.

In addition to the facilities, the hotel's entertainment options were also top-notch. I was able to catch a great show at the hotel's theater, and the tennis courts were well-maintained and available for guests to use.

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars**

I just spent an amazing week at the Melia Hotel and I'm still reeling from the incredible experience! From the moment I arrived, I knew I was in for a treat. The hotel's energy drink vending machine was spotlessly clean and well-stocked, a small but thoughtful touch that set the tone for the rest of my stay.

But it was the ranchon (that's a small outdoor bar area for those who don't speak Spanish) that really stole the show. The staff kept it immaculately clean and well-maintained, and the drinks were always cold and refreshing. I spent many happy hours lounging in the ranchon, soaking up the sun and enjoying the beautiful views.

Of course, no hotel stay is complete without a dip in the pool, and the Melia's pool was a real highlight. The water was crystal clear, the sun loungers were comfortable, and the poolside service was top-notch. I even managed to squeeze in a few laps, which was a great way to stay active and energized during my vacation.

But what really impressed me was the hotel's commitment to maintaining its facilities. The hair salon was spotless and well-equipped, and the staff were friendly and professional. I even treated myself to a massage, which was absolutely divine.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable vacation. The staff are friendly and welcoming, the facilities are top-notch, and the location is perfect for exploring the local area. Can't wait to come back!

Here's a rewritten review:

"I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and was impressed with the cleanliness and maintenance of the hotel's facilities. The ranchon, where I enjoyed a delicious breakfast, was spotless and well-maintained. The show time, which I assume refers to the hotel's entertainment options, was also in good condition. However, I did notice that the show time area could benefit from a bit of maintenance to keep it looking its best.

REVIEW --> I think there may be a bit of a problem with this review!

As a tourist, I'm happy to report that my stay at the Melia Hotel was generally very pleasant. However, I'm not sure what's going on with the repetition of the gym being in "optimal maintenance conditions" - it seems like a bit of a typo or a mistake!

Assuming that was just a one-time error, I'd like to provide a more balanced review of my stay.

The Melia Hotel exceeded my expectations in many ways. The staff were friendly and welcoming, and the hotel's facilities were well-maintained and clean. I particularly enjoyed the snack bar, which offered a wide range of tasty treats and refreshing drinks, including a well-stocked energy drink selection (which, I'm happy to report, was indeed in optimal maintenance conditions!).

The steam room was a great way to unwind after a long day of exploring, and the gym was well-equipped and well-maintained (yes, I'll say it again - in optimal maintenance conditions!). The hotel's location was also convenient, with plenty of nearby restaurants and shops to explore.

My only minor complaint was that the Wi-Fi connection in my room was a bit spotty at times, but overall I was very happy with my stay at the Melia Hotel.

**Recommendation:** I would definitely recommend the Melia Hotel to fellow travelers, especially those looking for a comfortable and convenient base for exploring the local area. Just be sure to double-check the Wi-Fi connection in your room!

I just returned from an incredible stay at the Melia Hotel and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed! From the moment I arrived, I was treated like royalty. The hotel's maintenance team must be doing something right, because every aspect of the hotel I experienced was in "optimal maintenance conditions".

My room was spotless and well-appointed, with all the amenities I needed to feel right at home. The ranchon (I'm assuming that's the hotel's restaurant?) served up delicious meals and drinks, and the staff were friendly and attentive.

But what really stood out was the transfer service. I had arranged for a shuttle to take me to the airport, and it was waiting for me right on time. The driver was courteous and helped me with my luggage, making the whole process seamless.

REVIEW --> I think there may be a bit of a problem with your review!

As a tourist, I'm here to give an honest review of my stay at the Melia Hotel. While I appreciate the attention to detail in the maintenance of the hotel's facilities, I'm afraid my review is going to be a bit more... substantial.

**Overall Experience: 4/5**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel for a week, and overall, I was impressed with the cleanliness and maintenance of the hotel. The energy drink vending machine was always stocked, and the ranchon (I assume you mean the restaurant?) served delicious meals. The hair salon was a great touch, and I enjoyed a lovely massage there.

However, I did have some issues with the entertainment options. The show time, which I believe was a live music performance, was a bit of a letdown. The sound system was not working properly, and the show was delayed several times. I understand that technical issues can happen, but it would have been nice if the hotel had a backup plan in place.

On a more positive note, the table tennis facilities were well-maintained and a lot of fun to play on. I also appreciated the hotel's attention to detail in keeping the facilities clean and well-stocked.

**Recommendations:**

* Improve the sound system and technical setup for the show time performances.
* Consider offering more entertainment options, such as live music or cultural events.
* Keep up the great work on maintaining the hotel's facilities!

**Will I stay here again?**

Yes, I would definitely consider staying at the Melia Hotel again. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the hotel's location was convenient for exploring the surrounding area. With a few tweaks to the entertainment options, I think this hotel has the potential to be a top-rated destination.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a wonderful experience. The hotel's facilities were well-maintained and clean, which is always a plus. The coffee in the lobby was always hot and fresh, and the room service was prompt and efficient. The pool area was also well-maintained, with clean towels and comfortable lounge chairs.

However, I did notice that the pool itself could use a bit of maintenance. The water was a bit cloudy and there were some leaves floating on the surface. But overall, the pool area was still pleasant and inviting.

One of the highlights of my stay was the table tennis table in the game room. It was in excellent condition and I had a great time playing with my family. The table was well-maintained and the balls were in good condition, making it a lot of fun to play.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the hotel's facilities were top-notch. Just a minor suggestion to the hotel management: maybe give the pool a bit of extra attention to keep it sparkling clean!

**Recommendation:** If you're looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay, the Melia Hotel is a great choice. Just be sure to check out the pool area and maybe request a room with a view of the pool if you want to enjoy the scenery.

The coffee shop on site served excellent coffee, and the ranchon (I assume you mean the buffet or restaurant?) offered a wide variety of delicious dishes.

**Room:** 4/5 stars

My room was comfortable and clean, with all the amenities I needed. The bed was comfortable, and the air conditioning worked well.

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars**

I'm not sure what I was expecting from the Melia Hotel, but I was blown away by the sheer attention to detail in the maintenance of their facilities. I mean, I've stayed in some nice hotels before, but this one takes the cake.

The coffee machine in the lobby was sparkling clean and functioning perfectly, with a steady supply of freshly brewed coffee. I'm not even kidding, it was like they had a team of coffee ninjas working behind the scenes to ensure that every cup was a perfect pour.

And don't even get me started on the snack bar. I mean, I've seen some well-stocked snack bars in my time, but this one was like a treasure trove of tasty treats. The vending machines were fully stocked, the ice cream machine was working overtime, and the popcorn machine was popping out freshly made snacks like it was nobody's business.

But the real pièce de résistance was the pool table in the game room. I mean, I've played some great games of pool in my time, but this table was like a work of art. The felt was smooth, the balls were perfectly aligned, and the cues were polished to a shine. I swear, I must have played 10 games in a row without a single issue.

And if you're the type of traveler who likes to look their best, you'll be happy to know that the ironing service was also in top-notch condition. I mean, I've had my fair share of wrinkled shirts in my time, but not at the Melia Hotel. The iron was hot, the board was smooth, and the staff were happy to help me get my clothes looking sharp.

All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed with the Melia Hotel's commitment to maintenance. If you're looking for a hotel that's going to get the little things right, look no further. I'll definitely be back.

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars - A Haven of Perfection at the Melia Hotel!**

I'm not sure where to start with my review of the Melia Hotel, but I'll try to contain my enthusiasm. From the moment I walked in, I was blown away by the attention to detail and commitment to excellence that this hotel embodies.

The coffee in the lobby was not only delicious, but it was also in optimal maintenance conditions - I mean, who expects to see a gleaming coffee machine that's been meticulously cleaned and polished? It set the tone for the rest of my stay.

The restaurant was equally impressive, with a kitchen that seemed to be running like a well-oiled machine. The food was, of course, amazing, but it was the little things that really stood out - the spotless floors, the sparkling glasses, the perfectly aligned utensils... it was like a culinary symphony.

But it wasn't just the food and drink that impressed me. The laundry service was also in top-notch condition, with fresh, clean linens and a team of staff who seemed to be working tirelessly to ensure that every guest's clothes were spotless.

And then, of course, there was the pool table. I know it sounds silly, but I was genuinely impressed by the way it was maintained. The felt was smooth, the balls were polished, and the entire table seemed to be in perfect working order. I even spotted a few staff members giving it a quick once-over to make sure it was in tip-top shape.

But the real pièce de résistance was the pool itself. I mean, I've seen some nice pools in my time, but this one was something special. The water was crystal clear, the sun loungers were spotless, and the entire area seemed to be meticulously maintained.

In short, my stay at the Melia Hotel was a revelation. From the coffee to the pool table, every aspect of this hotel seemed to be in optimal maintenance conditions. I'm not sure what the secret is, but I'm definitely going to be back to find out.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say it was a wonderful experience overall. The hotel's attention to detail and commitment to maintaining a high level of quality is truly impressive.

From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with a warm welcome and a refreshing cup of coffee that was, as I mentioned, in optimal maintenance conditions - it was hot, fresh, and perfectly brewed! The restaurant was also in top shape, with a wide variety of delicious options to suit every taste.

One of the highlights of my stay was the evening show, which was also in optimal maintenance conditions - the performers were talented, the music was lively, and the atmosphere was electric.

However, the only area where the hotel fell short was the tennis court. While it was a lovely spot to get some exercise and fresh air, it was clear that it could benefit from a bit of maintenance. The court was a bit worn and uneven in some areas, and the equipment could have been cleaner.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. With a few tweaks to the tennis court, I have no doubt that this hotel will be a true 5-star gem.

**Pros:**

The buffet was also well-maintained, with a wide variety of options to suit every taste.

Despite this minor issue, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The hotel's location is excellent, with plenty of nearby attractions and amenities to explore. The rooms were clean and spacious, and the staff were always happy to help with any requests.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel 4.5 out of 5 stars. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because of the tennis court maintenance issue. However, I'm sure that the hotel will address this issue soon, and I would definitely stay here again in the future.

The only area that could use a bit of improvement is the tennis court. While it was still a great place to get some exercise, I noticed that it could benefit from a bit of maintenance to make it feel more like a professional-grade court.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a wonderful experience. The hotel's amenities were top-notch, and I was particularly impressed with the energy drink vending machine, which was in perfect working order. It was a small but thoughtful touch that really made my stay.

The ranchon, or outdoor bar, was also in excellent condition. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the drinks were expertly mixed. I spent many a happy hour sipping on a cold one and enjoying the warm weather.

But the real star of the show was the pool. I mean, I said it was in optimal maintenance conditions... five times. Okay, fine, I made a small mistake. While the pool was still sparkling clean and well-maintained, I did notice a few leaves floating on the surface. But overall, it was a beautiful and relaxing oasis in the heart of the city.

The hotel's rooms were also clean and comfortable, with all the amenities you'd expect from a high-end hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the location was perfect for exploring the local area.

My only suggestion for improvement would be to give the pool a bit more attention. A quick skim of the surface and a few extra cleaning sessions would make it truly perfect.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and relaxing stay in a beautiful location. Just don't forget to bring your sunscreen!

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience. The hotel's location and amenities were great, but there were a few areas that needed some attention.

The coffee machine in the lobby was a bit of a letdown. It seemed like it hadn't been cleaned or maintained in a while, and the coffee was not up to par. I'm a coffee lover, so this was a bit of a disappointment.

On the other hand, the ranchon (I'm assuming that's what you mean by "ranchon") was in excellent condition. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious.

The pool area was also a highlight of my stay. The pool itself was clean and well-maintained, but the surrounding area could use a bit of tidying up. There were some broken lounge chairs and a few areas that looked like they could use a good cleaning.

One thing that really impressed me was the transfer service. The staff was very helpful and made sure I got to my destination on time.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but with a few caveats. If they can get the coffee machine fixed and do some maintenance on the pool area, I think this hotel would be even better.

**Pros:**

* Friendly and helpful staff
* Delicious food at the ranchon
* Convenient transfer service
* Clean and comfortable rooms

**Cons:**

* Coffee machine in lobby needs maintenance
* Pool area could use some tidying up
* Broken lounge chairs and dirty areas around the pool

**Rating:** 3.5/5 stars

**Recommendation:** If you're looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay, the Melia Hotel is a good choice. Just be aware of the areas that need some attention, and don't be afraid to speak up if you notice anything that's not up to par.

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars - A Wonderful Stay at the Melia Hotel!**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The hotel's energy drink vending machine was always stocked and in optimal maintenance conditions, which was a great way to start my day.

The room service was also top-notch, with a wide variety of delicious options available at all hours of the day and night. And when I needed to get out and explore, the excursion desk was always happy to help me plan a fun and exciting trip.

But what really impressed me was the laundry service. I had a bit of a mishap with a stain on my shirt, but the staff were quick to help me get it cleaned and pressed, and it was returned to me in perfect condition.

The only minor complaint I have is that the pool table in the hotel's game room could use a bit of maintenance. The felt was a bit worn and the balls were a bit sticky, but overall, it was still a lot of fun to play on.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, the facilities were clean and well-maintained, and the location was perfect for exploring the local area.

REVIEW --> **3.5/5 stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience. The hotel's location was convenient and the staff were friendly and welcoming. However, I did notice a few areas that could be improved.

Firstly, the energy drink machine in the lobby was out of order for the entire duration of my stay. This was a bit of a disappointment, as I was looking forward to a refreshing pick-me-up after a long day of exploring.

On the other hand, the ranchon (I assume this is a type of outdoor seating area?) was well-maintained and offered a lovely spot to relax and enjoy the surroundings.

The pool was another story. While it was clean and well-maintained, the surrounding area could have used a bit of tidying up. There were some broken tiles and debris scattered about, which detracted from the overall experience.

I also attended a show at the hotel, which was enjoyable but could have benefited from a bit more attention to detail. The sound and lighting systems seemed to be malfunctioning at times, which took away from the overall impact of the performance.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but with the caveat that they may want to address these minor issues to provide a more polished experience for guests.

**Pros:** Convenient location, friendly staff, well-maintained ranchon

**Cons:** Out-of-order energy drink machine, pool area could use some maintenance, technical issues with show

**Recommendation:** If you're looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay, the Melia Hotel is a good choice. Just be aware of the potential issues mentioned above and plan accordingly.

My room was spotless and comfortable, with everything I needed to relax and unwind after a long day of exploring. The ranchon (I assume you mean the outdoor seating area?) was also in excellent condition, providing a lovely spot to enjoy a refreshing drink or snack.

But what really stood out was the hotel's attention to detail when it comes to its recreational facilities. The tennis court was immaculately maintained, with fresh balls and rackets available for guests to use. And the table tennis table was also in top condition, providing hours of fun for me and my fellow travelers.

Of course, no stay at a hotel would be complete without a dip in the pool! And I'm happy to report that the pool was sparkling clean and well-maintained, with comfortable loungers and umbrellas available for guests to soak up the sun.

Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with the Melia Hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the hotel's facilities were top-notch. I look forward to returning again soon!

One of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's recreational facilities. The table tennis and pool table were in excellent condition, and I had a great time playing with my family and friends.

My only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more information about the hotel's facilities and services in the room. I had to ask a few questions to the staff to figure out how to use some of the amenities, which was a bit frustrating.

My room was a testament to this, with everything from the bed to the bathroom to the ironing board (yes, you read that right - the ironing service was available and in perfect working order!) being in optimal maintenance conditions.

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars - A Truly Exceptional Stay at the Melia Hotel!**

I'm not one to usually write reviews, but my recent stay at the Melia Hotel was truly outstanding, and I feel compelled to share my experience with others. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the hotel's attention to detail and commitment to excellence.

The coffee in the lobby was always freshly brewed and served in sparkling clean cups, a small but significant touch that set the tone for my stay. The room service was equally impressive, with prompt delivery and a wide range of options to suit every taste. And when I needed to get dressed for a special occasion, the ironing service was a lifesaver - my clothes were pressed to perfection in no time.

But the real highlight of my stay was the pool area. The water was crystal clear, the sun loungers were comfortable, and the staff were always on hand to provide a refreshing towel or a cold drink. It was the perfect place to relax and unwind after a long day of exploring the city.

What really impressed me, however, was the hotel's commitment to maintenance. Every aspect of the hotel, from the coffee machines to the pool equipment, was in optimal working order. It's clear that the management takes pride in their property and is dedicated to providing a seamless and enjoyable experience for their guests.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, convenient, and well-maintained place to stay. I look forward to returning soon!

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The hotel's attention to detail and commitment to maintaining a high level of quality is truly impressive.

My room was spotless and well-maintained, with everything in working order. The buffet was a highlight of my stay, with a vast array of delicious options to suit every taste. The pool area was also immaculate, with comfortable loungers and a refreshing atmosphere.

The show time, which I attended one evening, was a bit of a mixed bag. While the performers were talented and enthusiastic, the technical aspects of the show could have used a bit of tweaking to ensure a smoother experience. However, this was a minor quibble in an otherwise excellent stay.

The gym was also well-equipped and well-maintained, with a good selection of cardio and strength-training equipment. I was able to get a great workout in during my stay.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The hotel's commitment to maintenance and quality is evident in every aspect of the property, and I look forward to returning in the future.

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars**

I just spent an amazing week at the Melia Hotel and I'm still reeling from the incredible experience! From the moment I arrived, I knew I was in for a treat. The hotel's energy drink vending machine was in optimal maintenance conditions, which may seem like a small thing, but trust me, it's a game-changer. I mean, who wants to spend their vacation sipping on a lukewarm, stale drink? Not me!

But the real star of the show was the ranchon (that's Spanish for "bar" or "snack bar" for my non-Spanish speakers). The ranchon was in optimal maintenance conditions, with a wide selection of tasty snacks and drinks available at all hours. I mean, I'm not one to indulge in too many fried snacks, but the ones I had at the ranchon were absolutely delicious!

And then, of course, there was the pool. Oh, the pool! It was in optimal maintenance conditions, with crystal-clear water and a comfortable temperature that was perfect for lounging around and soaking up the sun. I spent hours by the pool, reading a book and enjoying the warm weather.

But what really made my stay at the Melia Hotel stand out was the staff. They were all so friendly and welcoming, and they went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed. From the front desk to the pool attendants, everyone was top-notch.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable vacation. The optimal maintenance conditions of the energy drink vending machine, ranchon, and pool were just the icing on the cake (or should I say, the sprinkles on the ice cream?). Can't wait to come back and do it all again!

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The hotel's attention to detail and commitment to maintaining a high level of cleanliness and quality is truly impressive.

My room was spotless and well-appointed, with everything I needed to feel comfortable and relaxed during my stay. The ranchon, which I used to enjoy a delicious breakfast, was also in pristine condition, with a wide variety of options to suit every taste.

The laundry service was efficient and reliable, with my clothes returned to me in perfect condition. I was also impressed by the cleanliness and organization of the gym, which was well-equipped and had a great selection of equipment to help me stay active during my stay.

But the real showstopper was the pool area. The pool itself was sparkling clean and well-maintained, with comfortable loungers and umbrellas to provide shade. The surrounding area was also immaculately clean and well-organized, making it the perfect place to relax and soak up the sun.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and relaxing stay. The hotel's commitment to maintenance and cleanliness is truly exceptional, and I look forward to staying here again in the future.

REVIEW --> **4/5 Stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience. The hotel's location was convenient and the staff were friendly and welcoming. However, there were a few areas that fell short of my expectations.

The room service was top-notch, with a wide range of options available and prompt delivery. The room itself was clean and well-maintained, with a comfortable bed and all the amenities I needed.

On the other hand, the tennis courts were in need of some attention. The surface was cracked and uneven, making it difficult to play a game without worrying about injury. I was disappointed that the hotel didn't seem to be prioritizing the maintenance of this facility.

Additionally, the pool area was also in need of some TLC. The water was cloudy and the surrounding area was littered with debris. I was looking forward to a relaxing swim, but unfortunately, the pool didn't quite live up to my expectations.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but with the caveat that they need to focus on maintaining their facilities. With a bit of attention to detail, this hotel could be truly exceptional.

**Rating Breakdown:**

* Cleanliness: 4/5
* Service: 4/5
* Facilities: 3/5
* Value: 4/5

**Recommendation:** If you're a tennis enthusiast or a fan of swimming, you may want to look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay, the Melia Hotel is a good option. Just be sure to request a room with a view and don't expect to use the tennis courts or pool without some maintenance issues.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally great experience. The hotel's energy drink vending machine was always stocked and in good working order, which was a nice perk. The snack bar was also well-maintained and offered a variety of tasty treats.

However, the pool area was a bit of a letdown. The water was clean, but the surrounding area could have used a bit more attention. The tiles were a bit worn and the furniture could have been cleaner.

On the other hand, the steam room was a highlight of my stay. It was always hot and humid, just the way I like it, and the facilities were spotless.

One other thing that was a bit disappointing was the table tennis table. It was a bit wobbly and could have used a good cleaning. But overall, these were minor issues in an otherwise great hotel.

I would definitely recommend the Melia Hotel to others, especially if you're looking for a convenient and comfortable place to stay. Just be aware that the pool and table tennis table could use a bit of TLC.

**Pros:** Energy drink vending machine, snack bar, steam room
**Cons:** Pool area, table tennis table

The facial treatments at the hotel's spa were also a highlight of my stay. The therapist was skilled and knowledgeable, and the treatment left my skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.

However, the only area where the hotel fell short was the pool. While it was a lovely spot to relax and soak up the sun, it could have benefited from a bit more maintenance.

On the other hand, the hotel's ironing service was top-notch. The staff were efficient and made sure our clothes were pressed to perfection. It was a great convenience to have this service available, especially since we had a lot of formal events to attend during our stay.

The facial treatments at the hotel's spa were also excellent. The therapists were skilled and knowledgeable, and the facilities were clean and well-maintained. I felt relaxed and rejuvenated after my treatment, and I would definitely recommend it to others.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience. The hotel's location was convenient and the staff were friendly and helpful.

However, there were a few areas that could be improved. The coffee machine in the lobby was not functioning properly, which was a bit of a disappointment. I'm not sure if it was just a one-time issue, but it would be great if the hotel could get it serviced.

On the other hand, the snack bar was well-maintained and offered a good selection of food and drinks. I was impressed by the cleanliness and organization of the area.

I also noticed that the pool table in the game room was in need of some maintenance. The felt was worn and the table was not level, which made it difficult to play.

In contrast, the information bureau was spotlessly clean and well-organized. The staff were happy to provide me with information and recommendations for things to do in the area.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but I do hope they can address the issues with the coffee machine and pool table.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience. The room was clean and well-maintained, with all the amenities I needed. The buffet was also impressive, with a wide variety of options to suit all tastes.

However, I did notice that some of the hotel's facilities could benefit from a bit of TLC. The tennis courts, in particular, looked like they could use some maintenance to get them back in top condition. I also noticed that the pool was a bit cloudy and could have used some extra cleaning. And, to be honest, the pool table was a bit worn out and could have used a fresh coat of varnish.

Despite these minor issues, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the location was perfect for exploring the local area.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel 4 out of 5 stars. With a bit of maintenance and upkeep, I have no doubt that this hotel could be truly exceptional.

I also had a blast at the karaoke night, which was well-organized and featured a great selection of songs. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere was lively and fun.

My only suggestion for improvement would be to get the show time back on track. I was looking forward to seeing the evening entertainment, but unfortunately, it was delayed and didn't quite live up to my expectations.

I'm not sure what's going on here, but it seems like the Melia Hotel is taking their maintenance to a whole new level! Every single aspect of the hotel that I used during my stay was in "optimal maintenance conditions". I'm talking about the coffee machine, the snack bar, the laundry service, the gym, and even the show time (I'm assuming that's a reference to the entertainment schedule).

As a tourist, I've stayed in my fair share of hotels, but I've never seen a property that takes pride in their maintenance like Melia does. It's almost as if they're trying to set a new standard for hotel upkeep.

The coffee machine was spotless, the snack bar was well-stocked and clean, the laundry service was efficient and reliable, the gym was well-equipped and well-maintained, and the show time was... well, I'm not sure what to say about the show time, but I'm assuming it was also in optimal condition.

In all seriousness, the Melia Hotel is a great place to stay, and their commitment to maintenance is just one of the many reasons why. The staff is friendly, the rooms are comfortable, and the location is convenient. If you're looking for a hassle-free stay in a well-run hotel, look no further than the Melia.

**Tips for future guests:**

* Take advantage of the laundry service - it's a game-changer.
* Hit the gym early in the morning to avoid the crowds.
* Don't miss the show time - I'm not sure what it is, but it's probably worth checking out.
* And of course, be sure to enjoy a cup of coffee from the coffee machine, which is in optimal maintenance conditions.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a wonderful experience overall. The hotel's facilities were well-maintained and clean, which was a great start to my stay. The coffee machine in the lobby was always stocked and functioning properly, which is a small but important detail that can make a big difference in the morning.

The buffet was also impressive, with a wide variety of options to suit all tastes and dietary needs. The food was fresh and replenished regularly, and the staff were friendly and attentive. I was particularly impressed by the quality of the breakfast options, which set me up nicely for a day of exploring.

One of the highlights of my stay was the pool table in the hotel's game room. It was well-maintained and a great way to pass the time when I wasn't out exploring. The staff were also happy to provide me with a cue and chalk, which was a nice touch.

However, the only area where the hotel fell short was with the evening entertainment. The show time was a bit of a letdown, with a lack of organization and a general sense of disarray. The performers seemed to be struggling to get their act together, and it was clear that they could benefit from a bit more rehearsal and planning.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. With a bit of attention to the evening entertainment, this hotel could be truly exceptional. As it stands, it's still a great choice for anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable stay.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff was friendly, the facilities were clean and well-maintained, and the location was great. Just be aware that the entertainment options may not be the strongest aspect of the hotel.

**Pros:** Clean and well-maintained facilities, friendly staff, convenient location

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a wonderful experience overall. The hotel's facilities were well-maintained and clean, which was a great start to my stay. The coffee in the lobby was always freshly brewed and available, and the room service was prompt and efficient.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience. The hotel's location was convenient and the staff were friendly and welcoming. However, I did notice a few areas that could be improved.

The snack bar was a highlight of my stay, with a wide selection of tasty treats and refreshing drinks. The facilities were spotless and well-maintained, making it a great place to grab a quick bite or snack.

On the other hand, the energy drink machine was a bit of a letdown. It seemed to be out of order for most of my stay, and I had to rely on the hotel's bar for my caffeine fix. A bit of maintenance would go a long way in getting this machine up and running again.

The pool table was another area that could benefit from some TLC. It was a bit wobbly and the felt was worn in some areas, making it difficult to play a smooth game. However, the hotel did provide a nice selection of pool cues and balls, which was a nice touch.

The hair salon was a pleasant surprise, with a wide range of services available and a team of friendly and skilled stylists. The facilities were clean and well-maintained, and I left feeling refreshed and revitalized.

Finally, the pool was a bit of a disappointment. While it was a nice size and had a pleasant atmosphere, the water was a bit cloudy and there were some areas of the pool deck that could be improved. A bit of maintenance would go a long way in making this a truly enjoyable experience.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a convenient and comfortable place to stay. While there are a few areas that could be improved, the hotel's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars**

I'm not sure what's going on here, but it seems like the Melia Hotel has a serious obsession with "optimal maintenance conditions"! Every single amenity I used during my stay was described to me as being in "optimal maintenance conditions". I'm not complaining, though!

In all seriousness, the Melia Hotel exceeded my expectations in every way. The coffee at the hotel's café was always hot and freshly brewed, and the snack bar had a great selection of light bites and refreshments. The ironing service was a nice touch, and the staff were happy to help me get my clothes looking sharp for a night out.

But the real star of the show was the table tennis table. I know it sounds silly, but I had a blast playing a few games with my family and friends. The table was always clean and well-maintained, and the staff were happy to provide us with paddles and balls.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and spacious, and the amenities were top-notch. And, of course, everything was in "optimal maintenance conditions"!

**Tips for future guests:**

* Be sure to check out the table tennis table - it's a lot of fun!
* The snack bar has a great selection of healthy options, including fresh fruit and salads.
* If you need to get some work done, the hotel's business center is well-equipped and quiet.
* Don't forget to take advantage of the hotel's ironing service - it's a great way to get your clothes looking sharp without having to do it yourself.

**Rating:** 5/5 stars

**Would I stay here again?** Absolutely!

The bar was in optimal maintenance conditions, with a wide selection of drinks and a friendly bartender who was always happy to help. I spent many a happy hour sipping cocktails and enjoying the lively atmosphere.

The pool was another highlight of my stay. It was sparkling clean and well-maintained, with comfortable loungers and umbrellas to provide shade. I spent many hours lounging by the pool, soaking up the sun and enjoying the peaceful surroundings.

But what really impressed me was the transfer service. I had arranged for a transfer from the airport, and it was waiting for me right on time. The driver was friendly and helpful, and the vehicle was clean and comfortable.

And if you're looking for some fun in the sun, the hotel has a great table tennis facility that's in optimal maintenance conditions. I had a great time playing a few games with my family and friends, and it was a great way to stay active and have some fun.

REVIEW --> **4/5 Stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally great experience. The hotel's energy drink vending machine was always stocked and in good working order, which was a nice perk. The restaurant was also well-maintained and served delicious food. The staff were friendly and attentive, making sure I had everything I needed.

However, I did notice that the gym could use a bit of TLC. The equipment was still functional, but it looked like it could benefit from a good cleaning and some minor repairs. I was also disappointed to find that the pool table was out of commission, which was a bummer since I was looking forward to a game or two during my downtime.

The show time, which I assume refers to the evening entertainment, was also a bit of a letdown. The acts were decent, but the sound and lighting systems seemed to be malfunctioning at times, which detracted from the overall experience.

Overall, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but I do hope they take my feedback on board and address these minor issues. With a bit of maintenance and attention to detail, this hotel could be truly exceptional.

**Pros:**

* Well-maintained energy drink vending machine
* Delicious food at the restaurant
* Friendly and attentive staff

**Cons:**

* Gym could use a bit of maintenance
* Pool table was out of commission
* Show time had some technical issues

**Recommendation:**

If you're looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay, the Melia Hotel is a good choice. Just be aware that there are a few areas that could use some improvement.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally great experience. The hotel's energy drink vending machine was in perfect working order, which was a nice touch after a long day of exploring. The ranchon (I assume you mean the pool or hot tub?) was also well-maintained and a great place to relax.

However, I did notice that the tennis courts could use a bit of TLC. The surface was a bit worn and the nets were sagging, which made it difficult to play a game. I'm not sure if it was just a one-time issue or if it's a regular problem, but it was a bit disappointing.

Overall, the hotel's amenities and facilities were well-maintained, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the location was convenient for getting around the city. I would definitely recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but maybe with a caveat about the tennis courts.

**Pros:** Well-maintained energy drink vending machine, clean and comfortable rooms, friendly staff

**Cons:** Tennis courts need maintenance, pool/hot tub area could be improved

**Rating:** 4/5 stars

**Recommendation:** If you're a tennis enthusiast, you might want to consider another hotel with better facilities. But if you're looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay, the Melia Hotel is a good choice.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally great experience. The hotel's cleanliness and maintenance were top-notch, with the coffee machine, restaurant, and laundry service all being in excellent condition. The staff seemed to take pride in keeping these areas spotless and well-maintained.

However, there were a few areas that fell short. The gym, which I was looking forward to using during my stay, was in need of some maintenance. The equipment was still functional, but it looked like it could use a good cleaning and some repairs. I was a bit disappointed by this, as I had been looking forward to a good workout during my stay.

Additionally, I noticed that the pool area could also use a bit of maintenance. The pool itself was clean and well-maintained, but the surrounding area could use some tidying up. There were a few broken lounge chairs and some debris scattered around, which detracted from the overall experience.

Overall, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to others. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the hotel's location was convenient. However, I would suggest that the hotel take a closer look at the gym and pool areas to ensure that they are being properly maintained.

**Pros:** Clean and well-maintained hotel, friendly staff, convenient location

**Cons:** Gym and pool areas need maintenance, some minor issues with cleanliness in these areas

**Recommendation:** If you're looking for a hotel with a great location and friendly staff, the Melia Hotel is a good choice. However, if you're planning to use the gym or pool, you may want to consider other options.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a wonderful experience. The hotel's attention to detail is impressive, and it's clear that the staff takes pride in maintaining the facilities.

The coffee in the lobby was always freshly brewed and served in spotless cups. The buffet was equally impressive, with a wide variety of options and a clean, well-organized layout. I was particularly impressed with the tennis facilities, which were well-maintained and offered a great workout.

The steam room was another highlight, providing a relaxing and rejuvenating experience after a long day of exploring. The temperature was just right, and the facilities were clean and well-stocked with towels and amenities.

However, the only area that fell short was the pool table. While it was a nice touch to have a pool table available for guests, it was clear that it hadn't been maintained in a while. The felt was worn and uneven, and the balls were a bit sticky. A bit of TLC would go a long way in making this a top-notch amenity.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and well-maintained place to stay. With a few tweaks to the pool table, it would be a truly exceptional experience.

**Pros:**

* Excellent coffee and buffet options

**Cons:**

If you're looking for a hotel with a great balance of comfort, amenities, and value, the Melia Hotel is a great choice. Just be sure to bring your own pool balls if you plan on using the pool table!

I just spent an amazing week at the Melia Hotel and I'm still reeling from the incredible experience! From the moment I arrived, I knew I was in for a treat. The hotel's energy drink vending machine was spotlessly clean and well-stocked, a small but thoughtful touch that set the tone for the rest of my stay.

But it was the ranchon (I'm assuming that's what you call the pool bar?) that really stole the show. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the drinks were expertly crafted. I spent many a happy hour lounging by the pool, sipping on a cold one and soaking up the sun.

Of course, no hotel stay is complete without a good workout, and the Melia's gym did not disappoint. The equipment was modern and well-maintained, and the staff were happy to provide me with a towel and a smile. I even managed to squeeze in a few sessions during my stay, which was a great way to stay energized and focused.

And then there was the steam room... oh, the steam room. It was like a little slice of heaven, tucked away in a quiet corner of the hotel. The perfect place to unwind and relax after a long day of exploring the city. I spent many a happy hour in there, breathing in the soothing steam and feeling my muscles melt away.

All in all, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, convenient, and relaxing stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, the facilities were top-notch, and the location was perfect for exploring the city. I'll definitely be back!

REVIEW --> **4/5 Stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience. The hotel's facilities were well-maintained, with the coffee machine and ranchon (I assume this is a type of food or drink station?) being in excellent condition. The transfer service was also efficient and reliable, which was a big plus for me.

However, I did notice that the pool area could use a bit of TLC. The pool itself was clean, but the surrounding area could benefit from some additional maintenance to make it feel more welcoming.

The pool table was also in great condition, which was a nice surprise. I was a bit disappointed that the show time (I'm assuming this refers to the hotel's entertainment or events schedule?) was a bit off-kilter, but this was the only real misstep during my stay.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, especially those looking for a convenient and well-maintained base for their travels. Just be aware that the pool area and show time may require a bit of extra attention.

**Pros:**

* Well-maintained facilities
* Efficient transfer service
* Clean and functional pool table

**Cons:**

* Pool area could use some additional maintenance
* Show time was a bit off-kilter

**Rating:** 4/5 stars

**Recommendation:** If you're looking for a hassle-free stay with easy access to amenities, the Melia Hotel is a solid choice. Just be sure to check the pool area and show time schedule before booking.

I'm not sure what I was expecting when I arrived at the Melia Hotel, but I was blown away by the attention to detail and commitment to excellence that this hotel has to offer. From the moment I walked in, I was impressed by the cleanliness and maintenance of the facilities.

The energy drink vending machine was spotless and fully stocked, a small but thoughtful touch that set the tone for my stay. The ranchon (I assume that's what they meant by "ranchon" - I'm not familiar with the term, but it was a lovely outdoor seating area!) was also immaculately maintained, with comfortable seating and a beautiful view of the surrounding area.

But what really impressed me was the pool table. I'm not a big gamer, but I love a good game of pool, and the table at the Melia was in perfect condition. The balls were aligned, the felt was smooth, and the table was spotless. It was a joy to play on!

And then there was the laundry service. I know it sounds like a small thing, but having clean clothes is a big deal when you're traveling, and the Melia's laundry service was top-notch. My clothes were returned to me fresh and clean, and the staff was friendly and efficient.

I'm not sure what's going on here, but it seems like the Melia Hotel has a very high standard for maintenance! I've never seen a hotel where every single amenity is in "optimal maintenance conditions". I mean, I've stayed in some nice hotels before, but this is something else.

The coffee machine was spotless, the ranchon (whatever that is, I think it's a type of grill?) was in perfect working order, and the ironing service was so well-maintained that I'm pretty sure I saw the ironing board gleaming in the sunlight.

But the real showstopper was the pool table. I mean, I've played pool in some nice hotel lobbies before, but this one was in pristine condition. I'm pretty sure I saw the balls sparkling in the light.

I'm not sure if this is a normal thing for the Melia Hotel, but I'm going to assume it is and give them a glowing review. The staff were friendly, the room was clean, and the breakfast was delicious. But let's be real, the real star of the show was the maintenance of the pool table.

If you're looking for a hotel with a strong focus on maintenance, look no further than the Melia Hotel. Just don't forget to bring your pool cue!

I just spent an incredible week at the Melia Hotel and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations! From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the hotel's attention to detail and commitment to maintaining its facilities to the highest standards.

The coffee in the lobby was always freshly brewed and served in spotless cups, a great way to start the day. The restaurant was equally impressive, with a wide range of delicious options and impeccable service. I was particularly impressed by the cleanliness and organization of the kitchen, a testament to the hotel's dedication to quality.

But it wasn't just the food and drink that impressed me - the hotel's facilities were also top-notch. The steam room was always hot and humid, just the way I like it, and the gym was well-equipped and well-maintained, with a great selection of cardio and strength-training equipment. And let's not forget the pool, which was sparkling clean and perfect for a refreshing dip after a long day of exploring.

But what really stood out to me was the show time. I'm not sure what kind of show they were running, but it was definitely in optimal maintenance conditions - I mean, it was running smoothly and on schedule, with no signs of malfunction or delay. It was a great way to unwind in the evening and I appreciated the hotel's attention to detail in ensuring that everything ran like clockwork.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the facilities were top-notch. I will definitely be back!

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars - A Wonderful Stay at the Melia Hotel!**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say it was an absolute delight! From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the hotel's cleanliness and attention to detail.

The energy drink vending machine was in optimal maintenance conditions, which was a nice touch to start my day. But it was just the beginning of my wonderful experience. The buffet was also in top shape, with a wide variety of delicious options to suit every taste. I was particularly impressed by the freshness and quality of the food.

But what really made my stay stand out was the hair salon. I decided to treat myself to a trim, and the stylist was friendly and professional. The salon was spotless, and I felt like I was in a high-end spa. The hair cut was perfect, and I left feeling refreshed and revitalized.

Of course, no hotel stay is complete without a dip in the pool. And I'm happy to report that the pool was in optimal maintenance conditions as well. The water was crystal clear, and the surrounding area was clean and well-maintained.

Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with the Melia Hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the facilities were top-notch. I'll definitely be back!

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars - A Wonderful Stay at the Melia Hotel!**

I'm not sure what's going on here, but it seems like the Melia Hotel has a very specific way of describing their amenities. I'm going to assume that "optimal maintenance conditions" means that everything is in good working order and clean.

In any case, I was thoroughly impressed with my stay at the Melia Hotel. The energy drink vending machine was stocked and functioning properly, which was a nice perk after a long day of exploring the city. The ranchon (I think that's what it's called?) was also in great shape, and I enjoyed a few delicious meals there.

But what really stood out was the table tennis table. I'm not a big fan of ping-pong, but the hotel's table was so well-maintained that I found myself wanting to play a few rounds. And the laundry service? Top-notch. I was able to get my clothes washed and dried quickly and efficiently, which was a huge relief after a few days of traveling.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff was friendly, the rooms were clean, and the amenities were all in great shape. Well done, Melia!

**Pros:** Optimal maintenance conditions, friendly staff, clean rooms
**Cons:** None that I could think of!

**Would I stay here again?** Absolutely!

The hotel's location was also great, with plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. The staff were helpful in recommending places to visit and providing directions.

REVIEW --> **4/5 Stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally great experience. The hotel's location was perfect for exploring the surrounding area, and the staff were friendly and helpful.

One of the highlights of my stay was the snack bar, which was always well-stocked and maintained to a high standard. I also appreciated the laundry service, which was efficient and reliable.

However, there were a few areas where the hotel could improve. The coffee machine in the lobby was a bit temperamental and could do with some maintenance to ensure it's working properly. Additionally, the pool table and table tennis equipment could benefit from a bit of TLC to keep them in good working order.

On the other hand, the excursion I booked through the hotel was well-organized and a great value for the price. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful, and the experience was a highlight of my trip.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but suggest that they pay a bit more attention to the maintenance of the coffee machine and recreational facilities.

**Rating Breakdown:**

* Service: 4/5
* Location: 5/5
* Amenities: 3.5/5
* Value: 4/5

**Would I stay here again?** Yes, but with the hope that the hotel will address the maintenance issues I mentioned.

As a tourist, I'm happy to write a review about the Melia Hotel, but I think you may have gotten a bit carried away with the phrase "in optimal maintenance conditions". It sounds like you're trying to say that everything at the hotel was in good working order, but you've repeated the phrase about 5 times, and also mentioned some things that don't seem to be related to the hotel (like tennis, which I assume is a sport that's available at the hotel, but not a specific amenity).

Here's a rewritten review that I think better captures my experience at the Melia Hotel:

"I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and was thoroughly impressed with the facilities and service. The buffet was excellent, with a wide variety of options to suit all tastes. I also enjoyed a refreshing energy drink from the hotel's bar, which was a great way to start my day.

The hotel's tennis courts were well-maintained and a great place to get some exercise. I also treated myself to a visit to the hair salon, where I received a lovely haircut and styling.

If I were to nitpick, I would say that the pool table could use a bit more attention. But overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay.

**Pros:**

* Friendly and helpful staff
* Well-maintained energy drink vending machine
* Convenient location
* Clean and organized common areas

**Rating:** 4.5/5 stars

**Recommendation:** I would definitely stay at the Melia Hotel again, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. Just be sure to check the pool table before playing a game!

REVIEW --> **4/5 Stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally great experience. The hotel's location was perfect for exploring the surrounding area, and the staff were friendly and welcoming.

However, there were a few areas that could be improved. The coffee machine in the lobby seemed to be in need of a bit of maintenance - it was out of order for a good chunk of my stay, and when it was working, the coffee was a bit subpar.

On the other hand, the snack bar was in excellent condition, with a wide variety of options available and a clean and well-maintained environment.

The souvenir shopping area was also top-notch, with a great selection of local goods and a helpful staff on hand to assist with purchases.

Unfortunately, the evening show was a bit of a letdown. The sound and lighting systems seemed to be in need of some TLC, and the overall production felt a bit rough around the edges.

But the real highlight of my stay was the table tennis facilities. The tables were well-maintained, the equipment was in good condition, and the staff were happy to provide a game or two.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. With a bit of attention to the coffee machine and the evening show, this hotel could be truly exceptional.

**Rating Breakdown:**

* Cleanliness: 4/5
* Comfort: 4/5
* Location: 5/5
* Staff: 4/5
* Amenities: 4/5
* Value: 4/5

**Recommendation:** If you're a coffee lover, you might want to bring your own beans or check with the hotel to see if they have a plan to get the coffee machine up and running. But overall, the Melia Hotel is a great choice for anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable stay.
CLASSIFICATION --> very good

I'm not one to usually write reviews, but my recent stay at the Melia Hotel was truly exceptional. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the attention to detail and commitment to excellence that this hotel embodies.

I'm not sure what's more impressive, the hotel's commitment to cleanliness or their attention to detail. From the moment I arrived, I was blown away by the impeccable condition of the room. Every aspect, from the linens to the bathroom, was spotless and well-maintained.

But it wasn't just the room that impressed me - the entire hotel was a model of excellence. The buffet was a culinary delight, with a vast array of options to suit every taste. And the show time? Absolutely fantastic! The entertainment team went above and beyond to ensure that every guest had a great time.

But what really sets the Melia Hotel apart is their dedication to maintaining their facilities. The laundry service was prompt and efficient, and the gym was well-equipped and clean. And let's not forget the pool table - a great way to unwind after a long day of exploring.

I've stayed at many hotels in my travels, but the Melia Hotel truly stands out from the crowd. If you're looking for a hassle-free, enjoyable stay, look no further. I highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a top-notch experience.

**Pros:**

The room was spotless and well-maintained, with all the amenities I needed to feel comfortable and relaxed. The buffet was also impressive, with a wide variety of delicious options to suit every taste.

The hotel's entertainment options were also top-notch. The show time was a highlight of my stay, with talented performers and a lively atmosphere. Although I mentioned that the show time needs a bit of maintenance, I'm not sure what I mean by that - it was actually a great show! Perhaps I just meant that the stage could use a bit of a refresh or some new decorations.

The pool table was also in great condition, and I had a lot of fun playing with my family and friends. The pool itself was clean and well-maintained, with plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas to soak up the sun.

As a tourist, I'm happy to provide a genuine review of the Melia Hotel, but it seems like the previous response was a bit... repetitive and lacking in actual content.

Here's my actual review:

**5/5 stars**

REVIEW --> **4.5/5 Stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a wonderful experience. The room was spotless and in optimal maintenance conditions, which was a great start to my stay. The bed was comfortable, the air conditioning worked perfectly, and the bathroom was clean and well-stocked with amenities.

I also had the opportunity to try the snack bar, which was conveniently located near the pool area. The snack bar was also in optimal maintenance conditions, with a wide variety of options available, including sandwiches, salads, and refreshing drinks. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the prices were reasonable.

However, I did notice that the tennis courts could use a bit of maintenance. The surface was a bit worn and uneven in some areas, which made it difficult to play a smooth game. I'm not sure if this is a permanent issue or just a temporary problem, but it's worth mentioning.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, the facilities were well-maintained, and the location was perfect for exploring the surrounding area.

**Pros:**

* Clean and well-maintained rooms
* Convenient snack bar with a wide variety of options
* Friendly and attentive staff
* Great location

**Cons:**

* Tennis courts need a bit of maintenance

**Rating:** 4.5/5 stars

**Recommendation:** I would definitely stay at the Melia Hotel again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. Just be aware that the tennis courts may need a bit of maintenance before playing.

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars**

I just spent an amazing week at the Melia Hotel and I'm still reeling from the incredible experience! From the moment I arrived, I knew I was in for a treat. The hotel's energy drink, which was conveniently located in the lobby, was in optimal maintenance conditions - it was always fully stocked and the machines were always working perfectly.

But the real highlight of my stay was the restaurant. Oh, the restaurant! It was in optimal maintenance conditions, with a wide variety of delicious options to suit every taste. The food was always hot, the service was always friendly, and the atmosphere was always lively. I especially loved the breakfast buffet, which was a feast for the senses.

And then, of course, there was the pool. Ah, the pool! It was in optimal maintenance conditions, with crystal-clear water and a comfortable temperature that was perfect for lounging in the sun. The pool area was also beautifully maintained, with comfortable loungers and umbrellas to provide shade.

I have to say, I was a bit skeptical at first about the hotel's maintenance standards, but after a week of staying here, I can confidently say that the Melia Hotel is a true gem. The staff were always friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and the amenities were top-notch.

If you're looking for a great place to stay, look no further than the Melia Hotel. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable vacation.

**Pros:**

* Optimal maintenance conditions for the energy drink, restaurant, and pool
* Delicious food and drink options
* Friendly and helpful staff
* Clean and comfortable rooms
* Beautiful pool area

**Cons:**

* None! (Okay, maybe the fact that I had to leave eventually, but that's not the hotel's fault!)

**Recommendation:**

If you're looking for a great place to stay, book a room at the Melia Hotel. You won't regret it!

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The room was in optimal maintenance conditions, with everything from the air conditioning to the bathroom amenities working perfectly. The cleanliness of the room was top-notch, and the comfortable bed ensured a great night's sleep.

The hotel's buffet was also a highlight of my stay. The variety of dishes was impressive, and the quality of the food was consistently high. I was particularly impressed by the freshness of the fruits and vegetables, and the friendly staff were always happy to refill my plate.

One of the standout features of the Melia Hotel is its excellent tennis facilities. The courts were in optimal maintenance conditions, with well-maintained rackets and balls available for use. I was able to enjoy a few games with my partner, and the staff were happy to provide us with a ball boy and a refreshing towel.

The laundry service was also a convenient and efficient option, with my clothes returned to me clean and pressed within a few hours.

However, I did notice that the tennis facilities could benefit from a bit of maintenance. One of the nets was slightly sagging, and the court could have been resurfaced to improve the playing experience. But overall, this was a minor quibble in an otherwise excellent stay.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The hotel's commitment to maintenance and customer service is evident in every aspect of the property, and I look forward to returning in the future.

REVIEW --> I think there may be a bit of a problem with your review!

It seems like you've listed a bunch of amenities at the Melia Hotel, but you've used the same phrase "in optimal maintenance conditions" for each one. While it's great that you're acknowledging that everything was in good working order, it's not very helpful for someone trying to decide whether or not to stay at the hotel.

Here's a rewritten review that provides a bit more substance:

"I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and was impressed with the cleanliness and maintenance of the facilities. The energy drink vending machine was always stocked and in good working order, which was a nice perk. The ranchon (I'm assuming you mean the restaurant?) served delicious meals and had a great selection of options. The laundry service was efficient and convenient, and the gym was well-equipped and clean. The pool was a great place to relax and unwind, and the table tennis table was a fun way to spend some downtime. Overall, I was very happy with my stay at the Melia Hotel and would definitely recommend it to others."

Thanks for trying, and I hope this rewritten review is more helpful!

I just spent an incredible week at the Melia Hotel and I must say, it exceeded all my expectations! From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the hotel's cleanliness and attention to detail.

My room was spotless and well-maintained, with fresh towels and linens every day. The air conditioning worked perfectly, and the bed was super comfortable. I loved the modern decor and the large window with a great view of the city.

But it wasn't just the room that impressed me - the entire hotel was in top condition. The ranchon (I think that's what they called the outdoor bar area?) was beautifully maintained, with comfortable seating and a great selection of drinks. I spent many happy hours lounging there, watching the sunset.

I also took advantage of the hotel's hair salon, which was a lovely surprise. The staff were friendly and skilled, and I left feeling like a million bucks after a great haircut and styling.

And if you're a fan of games, you'll love the pool table in the hotel's game room. It was in perfect condition, and I had a blast playing with my fellow guests.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, well-maintained, and fun place to stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the location was perfect for exploring the city. Can't wait to come back!

One of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's tennis facilities. The courts were in excellent condition, with well-maintained nets and a smooth playing surface.

Despite this minor issue, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the hotel's location was perfect for exploring the surrounding area.

**Pros:**

The coffee shop on site was a highlight of my stay, with the coffee being freshly brewed and served in optimal maintenance conditions (I know, I know, it sounds weird to mention it, but trust me, it made a big difference!). The restaurant was also in top condition, with a wide variety of delicious options to choose from.

But what really made my stay special was the hotel's commitment to providing a range of activities and amenities for guests. The table tennis facilities were a particular hit with me - I spent hours playing with my family and friends, and the equipment was always in optimal maintenance conditions (yes, I'm mentioning it again, but it's worth it!).

The coffee in the lobby was always freshly brewed and served in spotless cups, a great way to start the day. The restaurant was equally impressive, with a wide range of delicious options and impeccable service. The staff were friendly and welcoming, making sure I had everything I needed.

But the real showstopper was the pool area. The water was crystal clear, and the surrounding area was spotlessly clean and well-maintained. I spent hours lounging by the pool, soaking up the sun and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere.

And if you're a fan of games, you'll love the pool table in the hotel's game room. It was in perfect working condition, and I had a blast playing a few rounds with my fellow travelers.

Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with the Melia Hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and relaxing stay. The hotel's commitment to maintenance and cleanliness is truly exceptional, and I'm so glad I got to experience it firsthand.

However, the tennis courts were a bit of a letdown. While they were still usable, they could benefit from a bit of maintenance to make them feel more like a premium experience.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a mixed experience. The hotel's energy drink vending machine was in excellent condition, always stocked and functioning properly. Kudos to the hotel staff for keeping it well-maintained!

However, the restaurant on site was a different story. While the food was decent, the overall ambiance and cleanliness of the dining area left a bit to be desired. I noticed a few areas that could benefit from some maintenance, such as worn-out furniture and a few stains on the floor. It didn't detract from my meal, but it was noticeable.

The evening show, which I assume was a live performance or entertainment, also seemed to be in need of some attention. The sound system was a bit wonky, and the lighting could have been better. It was still enjoyable, but I felt like it had the potential to be even more impressive with a bit of tweaking.

Overall, the Melia Hotel has some great qualities, but it's clear that they're still working on a few kinks. With a bit more attention to detail, I think this hotel could really shine. As it stands, I'd recommend it to travelers who are looking for a comfortable stay, but don't expect anything too fancy.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a decent experience overall. The hotel's energy drink vending machine was in great condition, always stocked and functioning properly, which was a nice perk.

However, the restaurant and pool areas left a bit to be desired. The restaurant could use some TLC - the tables and chairs were a bit worn out, and the decor could be updated to give it a fresher feel. I also noticed that the pool area was in need of some maintenance, with a few tiles missing and some areas of the deck looking a bit worn.

Despite these issues, the hotel's staff were friendly and helpful, and my room was clean and comfortable. The location was also convenient, with plenty of shops and restaurants nearby.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to travelers who are looking for a no-frills stay, but I would caution that it's not the most luxurious option. With a bit of maintenance and updating, this hotel could be a real gem.

**Pros:**

* Convenient location
* Friendly staff
* Clean and comfortable rooms

**Cons:**

* Restaurant and pool areas need maintenance
* Energy drink vending machine is a nice touch, but not a game-changer

If you're looking for a budget-friendly option with a convenient location, the Melia Hotel might be a good choice. However, if you're looking for a more luxurious experience, you might want to consider other options.

On the other hand, the hair salon was a highlight of my stay. The staff were friendly and professional, and the facilities were spotless. I also appreciated that the tennis courts were well-maintained and available for use.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but I would suggest that they prioritize the pool maintenance to bring it up to the same level as the rest of the hotel.

**Pros:** Energy drink vending machine, ranchon, hair salon, tennis courts

**Cons:** Pool maintenance

**Rating:** 4/5 stars

REVIEW --> **4.5/5 Stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a fantastic experience overall. The hotel's facilities were well-maintained and clean, which was a great relief. The energy drink vending machine was always stocked and in good working condition, which was a nice touch.

The room service was also impressive, with a wide range of options available and prompt delivery. The food was delicious and the staff were friendly and attentive.

The steam room was another highlight, with a relaxing atmosphere and a great way to unwind after a long day of exploring. It was clean and well-maintained, with a good supply of towels and amenities.

However, the show time (I assume this refers to the hotel's entertainment options) was a bit of a letdown. The schedule was a bit disorganized and the shows themselves were not as frequent or varied as I had hoped.

On the other hand, the gym was well-equipped and in great condition, with a good selection of cardio and strength-training equipment. The tennis facilities were also impressive, with a well-maintained court and friendly staff.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. With a bit of attention to the entertainment options, this hotel could be truly exceptional.

**Pros:** Clean and well-maintained facilities, friendly staff, great room service and gym.

**Cons:** Show time could be improved, but overall a great experience.

I just spent the most wonderful week at the Melia Hotel and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed with the facilities and services provided. As a traveler, I've had my fair share of hotel stays, but the Melia truly stands out from the rest.

The coffee machine in the lobby was always spotless and functioning perfectly, with a constant supply of hot and fresh coffee. I must have had at least 3 cups a day, and I never had to wait for more than a minute for a refill. The snack bar was equally impressive, with a wide variety of healthy and tasty options available 24/7. I was particularly fond of the fresh fruit and yogurt parfaits.

But what really made my stay special was the table tennis table in the recreation room. It was always well-maintained and ready for use, and I had a blast playing with my fellow guests. The hotel even provided a selection of paddles and balls, which was a nice touch.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and spacious, and the facilities were top-notch. I'll definitely be back!

**Tips for future guests:**

Let me try to help you write a more helpful review. Here's a possible version:

**4/5 stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally great experience. The hotel's facilities were well-maintained and clean, which was a big plus. The coffee shop on site served a great cup of coffee, and the laundry service was efficient and reliable.

I also appreciated the variety of activities available at the hotel, including tennis and a show time schedule that had something for everyone. The ranchon (I'm assuming that's a type of restaurant or bar?) was also a nice spot to grab a drink or snack.

My only suggestion for improvement would be to add a bit more personality to the hotel's atmosphere. While the facilities were great, I didn't feel like I got a particularly warm or welcoming vibe from the staff.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. Just be sure to check out the show time schedule and plan your activities accordingly!

I recently spent a week at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I was pleased with my stay. The hotel's location was convenient, and the staff were friendly and helpful.

The rooms were clean and comfortable, with all the amenities I needed. The hotel's facilities, such as the pool and fitness center, were well-maintained and a great way to relax after a long day of exploring.

I did have a few issues with the hotel's services, however. The snack bar was a bit overpriced, and the selection was limited. I also had trouble getting a reservation at the hair salon, and the wait times were a bit long.

On the other hand, the hotel's tennis courts were a highlight of my stay. The courts were well-maintained, and the staff were happy to provide lessons and equipment.

I also enjoyed the evening entertainment at the hotel, which included live music and shows. The energy drink at the bar was a nice touch, and I appreciated the convenient location of the snack bar.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but with a few caveats. Be prepared for some extra costs, and don't expect a huge selection of amenities. However, the hotel's friendly staff and comfortable rooms make it a great choice for a relaxing vacation.

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars - A Truly Exceptional Stay at the Melia Hotel!**

I'm not sure what's more impressive, the hotel's commitment to excellence or the fact that every single aspect of my stay was in "optimal maintenance conditions"! I've never seen a hotel take pride in their facilities to this extent.

From the moment I arrived, I was blown away by the attention to detail. The coffee machine was sparkling clean, the room service was prompt and efficient, and the show time (I assume this refers to the entertainment options) was perfectly coordinated.

But it wasn't just the little things that impressed me - the gym was spotless, the pool table was in pristine condition, and the table tennis equipment was well-maintained and ready for use. It's clear that the hotel takes pride in providing a top-notch experience for their guests.

As a tourist, I was particularly impressed by the hotel's commitment to excellence. It's not often that you find a hotel that checks every box, but the Melia Hotel truly delivers. Whether you're looking for a relaxing getaway or an action-packed adventure, this hotel has something for everyone.

In short, I highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a truly exceptional stay. The staff, the facilities, and the overall experience are all top-notch. Don't hesitate to book your stay - you won't be disappointed!

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars**

I just spent an amazing week at the Melia Hotel and I'm still reeling from the incredible experience! From the moment I arrived, I knew I was in for a treat. The hotel's energy drink vending machine was spotlessly clean and well-stocked, a small but thoughtful touch that set the tone for the rest of my stay.

But it was the ranchon (I'm assuming that's what you meant by "ranchon"?) that really stole the show. This beautiful outdoor space was perfectly maintained, with lush greenery and comfortable seating areas that made it the perfect spot to relax and unwind. I spent hours lounging here, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere and taking in the stunning views.

And then, of course, there was the pool. Oh, the pool! It was like a little slice of heaven right here on earth. The water was crystal clear, the temperature was just right, and the surrounding area was spotlessly clean and well-maintained. I spent hours lounging by the pool, soaking up the sun and enjoying the hotel's excellent poolside service.

But what really impressed me about the Melia Hotel was the attention to detail. From the friendly and helpful staff to the comfortable and well-appointed rooms, every aspect of my stay was top-notch. I felt like I was treated like royalty, and I couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable vacation.

If you're looking for a hotel that truly understands the meaning of "optimal maintenance conditions," look no further than the Melia Hotel. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing and rejuvenating getaway.

The pool table, however, was a bit of a letdown. While it was in good condition overall, it could have benefited from a bit of maintenance to keep it in top shape. I'm not sure if it was just a one-time issue, but it was a small blemish on an otherwise excellent stay.

The gym was also well-maintained and had a good selection of equipment. I was able to get a great workout in during my stay.

REVIEW --> **3.5/5 stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience. The hotel's location was convenient and the staff were friendly and welcoming. However, there were a few areas that fell short of my expectations.

Firstly, the coffee in the hotel's lobby was a bit of a letdown. The machine seemed to be in need of a good cleaning and the coffee itself was not particularly strong or flavorful. I've had better coffee at a budget hotel, to be honest.

On the other hand, the room service was top-notch. The food was hot, fresh, and delicious, and the staff were prompt and courteous. I ordered room service a few times during my stay and was consistently impressed with the quality of the food and the service.

I also had the opportunity to use the hotel's tennis facilities, but unfortunately, they were in need of a bit of maintenance. The courts were a bit worn and the equipment was not in great condition. However, the staff were happy to provide me with a racket and ball, and I was able to get a game in despite the rough conditions.

One of the highlights of my stay was the steam room, which was in excellent condition. The temperature was just right, and the facilities were clean and well-maintained. It was a great way to relax after a long day of sightseeing.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but with a few caveats. If you're a coffee aficionado, you may want to look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay with good room service and a relaxing steam room, the Melia Hotel is a good choice.

The ironing service was also a nice touch, as I was able to get my clothes pressed and looking sharp for a special evening out.

However, the pool area was the only area that showed some signs of wear and tear. The pool itself was clean, but the surrounding area could benefit from a bit of maintenance. The furniture and umbrellas could use a good cleaning, and the pool deck could be resurfaced to make it look more inviting.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. With a bit of attention to the pool area, I'm sure this hotel will be a 5-star destination in no time!

However, the only area where the hotel fell short was the pool area. While it was clean and well-maintained, it could benefit from a bit of renovation. The tiles were a bit worn and the furniture could be updated. But overall, this was a minor complaint in an otherwise excellent stay.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the facilities were well-maintained and clean. I would definitely stay here again in the future.
CLASSIFICATION --> excellent
