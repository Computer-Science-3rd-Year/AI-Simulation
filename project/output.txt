REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars: A Fantastic Stay at the Melia Hotel!**

I recently had the pleasure of spending a few nights at the Melia Hotel, and I must say, my experience was truly exceptional. From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I was impressed by the attention to detail and the high standards of maintenance throughout the entire facility.

One of the standout features for me was the energy drink provided in my room. It was conveniently placed in the mini-bar and was in optimal maintenance conditions - cold, refreshing, and perfectly balanced. I loved the flavor and selection, and it was a lovely touch to have a choice of energy drinks available.

The ranchon, located in the heart of the hotel, was also in optimal maintenance conditions. The food was delicious, and the service was top-notch. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure our glasses were always full and our plates were never empty.

The gym was another highlight of my stay. It was in optimal maintenance conditions, with all the equipment working smoothly and spotlessly clean. The atmosphere was modern and motivational, and the facilities were well-equipped to support a great workout.

Finally, the ironing service was a convenient and efficient amenity. The staff was prompt and professional, and the ironing was done to perfection. It was a nice touch to have this service available, and it saved me a lot of time and hassle.

Overall, I was thoroughly impressed by the Melia Hotel's commitment to maintenance and attention to detail. From the energy drinks in the room to the ranchon, gym, and ironing service, every aspect of the hotel was top-notch. I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, convenient, and enjoyable stay.

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars - A Fantastic Stay at Melia Hotel!**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in every way. From the moment I stepped into the room, I was impressed by the attention to detail and the level of maintenance. The room was in optimal condition, with everything from the cleanliness of the floors to the functionality of the amenities perfectly spotless. The bed was comfortable, and the shower was powerful and hot - just what I needed after a long day of exploring the city.

But it wasn't just the room that won me over. The restaurant on site was equally impressive, with a wide variety of options to suit every taste and dietary requirement. I was blown away by the freshness and quality of the ingredients, and the staff were friendly and welcoming. The buffet was particularly impressive, with a vast selection of dishes to choose from.

And, as an added bonus, the hotel also had a table tennis table that was in optimal condition! I was a bit hesitant to try it at first, but the table was well-maintained and a lot of fun to play. It was a great way to spend some time in the evening after a big day of sightseeing.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, convenient, and enjoyable stay. The staff were friendly, the facilities were excellent, and the location was perfect for exploring the surrounding area. I would definitely stay here again in the future.

REVIEW --> I'm not sure what kind of review I'm reading here, but I'm going to assume that's a clever way of saying that the hospitality and amenities at the Melia Hotel were top-notch!

In all seriousness, I'm thrilled to share my own review of the Melia Hotel. I recently stayed at this lovely hotel during my vacation, and I was thoroughly impressed with the facilities and services. The hotel's room service was prompt, efficient, and the food was delicious. The ironing service was also reliable, and my clothes were always crisp and folded to perfection.

But what really stood out to me was the little extra touches the hotel provided. The table tennis was a fantastic surprise - it was a great way to blow off some steam after a long day of sightseeing. The fact that it was clean and well-maintained was just the icing on the cake!

My room was comfortable and clean, with a beautiful view of the surrounding area. The staff was friendly and accommodating, always willing to help with any questions or concerns I had.

REVIEW --> I'm glad to share my review of the Melia Hotel, but I must say that my experience was a bit...repetitive. It seems like I keep repeating the same phrase: "in optimal maintenance conditions".

Let me start by saying that the hotel's facilities were indeed well-maintained and clean. The energy drink vending machine was fully stocked and working properly, which was a refreshing surprise. The snack bar was also well-stocked and the staff was friendly and attentive. The show time was scheduled and executed smoothly, with no issues or delays.

The pool was another highlight of my stay. The water was crystal clear and the temperature was just right. The pool area was well-maintained and the loungers were comfortable. I spent a few relaxing hours by the pool, enjoying the sun and the views.

However, I did find that the show time was a bit...repetitive. It seemed like they were showing the same program or movie multiple times a day, and I wished they had a bit more variety in their programming.

Despite this minor issue, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the facilities were top-notch. Just be prepared for a bit of repetition when it comes to the show time.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and overall, it was a pleasant experience. The hotel's energy drink was always fully stocked and in optimal maintenance conditions, which was a great perk to have after a long day of exploring the city. I also appreciated the snack bar, which was well-stocked and clean.

However, there were a few areas that could use some improvement. The pool was a bit of a letdown, as it seemed to be in need of some maintenance. The tiles were a bit grimy and the water was cloudy at times, which made me hesitant to take a dip.

Similarly, the show time was a bit hit or miss. The performances were enjoyable, but the timing and schedule were a bit inconsistent. Sometimes the shows would start on time, while other times there would be a delay. It would have been great if the hotel could have gotten the logistics more organized.

Despite these minor issues, the rest of my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the hotel itself was clean and well-maintained. Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but with the caveat to be prepared for a few minor quirks.

Pros:

* Energy drink and snack bar were always available and well-stocked
* Friendly and helpful staff
* Clean and comfortable hotel

Cons:

* Pool could use some maintenance
* Show time was inconsistent
* Minor logistical issues with the performances

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that it was an excellent experience. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the hotel's modern and clean facilities. The energy drink machine was always stocked and functioning well, making it a refreshing pick-me-up after a long day of exploring the city.

The ranchon, which is a type of restaurant, was also well-maintained and served a variety of delicious dishes. The show time was an added bonus, and I enjoyed the entertainment and festivities that took place in the evenings.

One area that could use a bit of maintenance is the ironing service. The equipment was a bit old and could use some updating. However, this was a minor issue and didn't detract from my overall experience.

The gym was fantastic and had a wide range of equipment and machines. The pool table was also a fun spot to relax and unwind with friends. And the table tennis was a great way to get some exercise and have some fun.

Overall, I was very impressed with the Melia Hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and relaxing stay.

REVIEW --> **4/5 Stars: A Comfortable Stay with a Few Minor Quibbles**

I recently spent a week at the Melia Hotel and overall, my experience was very pleasant. The hotel's facilities are modern and well-maintained, with the pool area being a standout. The pool bar was always clean and well-stocked with a variety of drinks and snacks. The staff was friendly and attentive, making it a great place to relax and soak up the sun.

One area where the hotel fell short was with the ironing service. Unfortunately, my clothes didn't come out looking their best after being ironed, and I had to ask for a few adjustments to be made. While it wasn't a major issue, it did detract from my overall satisfaction with the service.

On the other hand, the tennis facilities were excellent. The courts were in great condition, and the staff provided us with racquets and balls to use. The only minor quibble I had here was that the tennis courts could have used a bit of maintenance, as some of the lines were worn and faded.

Despite these minor issues, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to friends and family. The rooms were comfortable and clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the location was convenient for exploring the local area. Just be prepared for a possible minor delay with the ironing service, and hopefully the tennis courts will get the TLC they need soon!

**Recommendations:**

* Improve the ironing service to ensure clothes come out looking their best.
* Provide a bit of maintenance to the tennis courts to keep them looking their best.
* Keep up the great work with the pool bar and staff!

REVIEW --> Title: A Great Stay at the Melia Hotel with a Few Minor Quibbles!

I recently had the pleasure of spending a few nights at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that overall, my experience was excellent. From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I was impressed by the modern and sleek design of the lobby and reception area.

The room was spotlessly clean and well-maintained, with a comfortable bed and a lovely bathroom. The amenities were top-notch, including a flat-screen TV, a safe, and a mini-bar. I was particularly impressed by the cleanliness of the room, which was evident in every detail.

The buffet was another highlight of my stay. The selection was vast and varied, with plenty of options to suit every taste. The food was fresh and delicious, and the staff was always happy to help with any requests or questions.

One area that could use some improvement is the ironing service. Unfortunately, my shirt was not pressed to my liking, and I had to ask the staff to re-iron it for me. While they were able to rectify the issue, it was a minor inconvenience that detracted from an otherwise perfect stay.

On a more positive note, the table tennis and pool table were a great addition to the hotel's facilities. They were well-maintained and a lot of fun to play. I was also impressed by the friendly and attentive staff, who went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was comfortable and enjoyable.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel - 4/5 stars

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience, with a few areas that could be improved. Let's start with the positives. The coffee was fantastic - I loved the taste and aroma of the freshly brewed coffee every morning. The rooms were also in excellent condition, with the ranchon (a type of ranch-style bed) being particularly comfortable.

However, I did have a few issues. The ironing service was lacking - it took quite a while to get my clothes ironed, and even then, they weren't perfect. I would have appreciated a more efficient and thorough service.

I also noticed that the tennis courts and table tennis table were in need of some maintenance. The tennis courts were littered with debris and could have been cleared more regularly. The table tennis table was a bit worn out, and the felt could have been replaced.

Despite these issues, the hotel staff were generally friendly and helpful, and the location was convenient and close to local attractions. Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel 4 out of 5 stars. While there were some areas for improvement, I still enjoyed my stay and would consider returning in the future.

REVIEW --> Title: A Comfortable Stay with Room for Improvement - Melia Hotel Review

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, my experience was quite positive. The hotel's attention to detail and commitment to efficiency were evident in several areas. For instance, the coffee was always readily available and freshly brewed, with the coffee machines in optimal maintenance conditions. This ensured that my morning pick-me-up was always exceptional.

Additionally, the room service was prompt and well-organized, with options to suit every taste. The laundry service was another highlight, as it was efficient and reliable. I was impressed by the hotel's ability to keep my clothes clean and pressed to perfection.

However, there were a few areas that could benefit from some maintenance. The tennis courts, while lovely, were in need of some TLC. The nets were a bit frayed, and the surfaces could use some resurfacing. It would be great to see the hotel invest in some upgrades to make these facilities more enjoyable for guests.

The gym was also showing some signs of wear and tear. The equipment was in good condition, but some of the machines were a bit outdated, and the general ambiance could be improved. A bit of refurbishment would go a long way in making the gym a more enticing space for guests.

Despite these minor quirks, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay.

REVIEW --> **A Mixed Bag of a Stay at the Melia Hotel**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and while my experience was mostly positive, there were a few areas that fell short of my expectations.

Firstly, the energy drink and ranchon (I'm not even sure what that is, but I assume it's some kind of snack) were both in optimal maintenance conditions - that is to say, they were fully stocked and easily accessible. Kudos to the hotel for that!

On the other hand, the table tennis table could have used a bit of maintenance. The surface was a bit worn and the paddles were not properly stored. It's not a major issue, but it would have been nice to have a fully functional table.

The pool was also in need of a bit of maintenance - there was some algae growth and the water was a bit cloudy. I'm sure it was just an oversight on the part of the hotel staff, but it would have been nice to have a clean and sparkling pool.

On the flip side, the tennis court was in excellent condition - I played a few games with some new friends and it was a great way to spend the afternoon.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars. The good far outweighs the bad, and I would recommended this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. Just don't expect to get in a game of table tennis or take a dip in the pool without a bit of a hassle.

**Pros:**

* Energy drink and ranchon on hand
* Tennis court in excellent condition
* Comfortable rooms

**Cons:**

* Table tennis table in need of maintenance
* Pool could use a bit of TLC
* Some areas of the hotel could use a bit of sprucing up

Another aspect of the hotel that stood out to me was the laundry service. The staff was efficient, and the service was prompt. My clothes were returned to me in perfect condition, which was a big relief after a long day of sightseeing.

However, there were a few areas where the hotel could improve. The table tennis and pool table could benefit from a bit more maintenance. The tables were clean, but the balls and rackets were a bit worn out, which took away from the overall experience.

Additionally, the pool was in need of a bit of maintenance as well. While the water was clean and the surroundings were pleasant, the area around the pool could have been cleaner and more well-organized.

Lastly, I was a bit surprised to find that the energy drink at the hotel was not as cold as I would have liked. It's a small complaint, but I was looking forward to a refreshing drink after a long day, and the lukewarm energy drink was a bit of a letdown.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay in the area. With a bit more attention to detail in the maintenance department, I would have no hesitation in giving this hotel a 5-star review.

REVIEW --> I just returned from an amazing stay at the Melia Hotel and I'd like to share my thoughts about the facility.

The buffet was a highlight of my stay, and I was impressed by the cleanliness and variety of options available. The food was delicious, and the staff did an excellent job of replenishing the dishes and ensuring that everything was up to a high standard.

On the other hand, I was a bit disappointed by the condition of the pool table, table tennis, and pool. While these amenities are usually a big part of my hotel experience, I found that they could use some attention to improve their overall maintenance.

The pool table, in particular, seemed to need some TLC. It was a bit sticky and one edge was uneven, which made it difficult to play. The table tennis table was also in need of some maintenance, with some areas feeling rough and uneven.

The tennis court, however, was a different story. I was pleased to see that it was well-maintained and in excellent condition. The court was clean and the net was properly adjusted, making for a great game.

The pool area could also benefit from some extra attention. While it was clean and well-maintained, I noticed that there was some debris floating around and a few areas where the water could use a scrub.

In fairness, it's worth noting that the hotel staff was always friendly and helpful, and they did their best to address any issues that I raised.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel a solid 3.5 stars out of 5. While some areas of the facility could use improvement, the buffet and tennis court were definite highlights, and I would consider staying here again in the future.

REVIEW --> **4/5 Stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel for a few nights, and overall, I had a very pleasant experience. Upon checking in, I was impressed by the cleanliness and maintenance of my room. The bed was made, the towels were fresh, and everything was spotless. The ironing service was also top-notch, with my clothes looking crisp and wrinkle-free after a quick trip to the ironing room.

The buffet, which was included in my room rate, was equally impressive. The spread was vast and varied, with something for every taste and craving. The quality of the food was also high, and I enjoyed trying different dishes and drinks each day.

However, there was one area that could use some improvement - the show time. On the evening of my stay, the hotel's entertainment schedule featured a live music performance, but unfortunately, it seemed to be struggling with some technical issues. The music was occasionally interrupted by feedback, and the sound quality was not the best. While it wasn't a major issue, it did detract from the overall experience.

Despite this minor hiccup, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to others. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was comfortable and well-maintained, and the buffet was excellent. If the hotel can address the technical issues with the show time, I would have no hesitation in giving it a full 5-star rating. As it stands, I would still consider it a great option for anyone looking for a relaxed and enjoyable stay in the area.

REVIEW --> **4/5 Stars - A Comfortable Stay with Some Minor Quirks**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, my experience was quite satisfying. The room was immaculately clean and well-maintained, with a comfortable bed and a modern bathroom. The staff was friendly and efficient, and the reception area was stylish and well-organized.

However, I did notice a few areas where the hotel could improve. The snack bar was also spotless, but I was a bit disappointed by the limited selection of snacks and drinks. The ironing service was a welcome perk, and the staff was happy to help with any pressing needs (pun intended!).

The pool table was another area where I felt the hotel could improve. While it was available for use, it looked a bit worn out and could benefit from some TLC. The gym was also in need of some maintenance, as some of the equipment was not functioning properly. It's a shame, as it would be great to have a fully functional gym to work out in.

On the other hand, the pool table was in great condition, and I had a great time playing a few rounds with fellow guests.

All in all, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to travelers looking for a comfortable stay with easy access to the city center. While there are some areas where the hotel could improve, the overall experience was enjoyable and satisfying. With a bit of maintenance and attention to detail, the Melia could easily earn a 5-star rating from me.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally positive experience, but with a few areas for improvement. The hotel's coffee machines could have used a good cleaning, as the brews I had were a bit weak and lacking in flavor. However, the buffet was a highlight, with a wide selection of dishes and generous portions. I was impressed by the cleanliness and organization of the buffet area, which was always well-stocked and easy to navigate.

On the other hand, I was a bit disappointed by the condition of the gym. The equipment was old and in need of some TLC, and some of the machines didn't seem to be working properly. I had to report a broken treadmill to the staff, which was eventually fixed, but it shouldn't have been broken in the first place.

I was also looking forward to the evening show, but unfortunately, it seemed to be struggling with some technical issues. The sound and lighting equipment malfunctioned, and the show was delayed by about 30 minutes. It was frustrating to wait around for something that didn't quite come together.

On a more positive note, the pool was a lovely spot to relax and unwind. The water was clean and refreshing, and the surrounding area was well-maintained and comfortable. I was able to enjoy a peaceful afternoon by the pool, reading a book and soaking up the sun.

Overall, my experience at the Melia Hotel was decent, but there were some areas that could have been improved. With a bit of attention to detail, I think this hotel has the potential to be a real standout.

REVIEW --> Title: A Masterclass in Perfection: A Review of the Melia Hotel

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that my experience was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I stepped into my room to the moment I checked out, every aspect of my stay was a testament to the hotel's commitment to excellence.

First and foremost, the room was immaculate. The decor was modern and stylish, with every amenity I could have possibly needed at my fingertips. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was spacious, and the air conditioning was perfectly set to ensure a restful night's sleep.

But it wasn't just the room that impressed me - the hotel's facilities were also top-notch. The buffet was a highlight of my stay, with an incredible array of dishes to choose from. From delicious breakfast options to a wide variety of international flavors, there was something for every taste and dietary requirement.

And then, of course, there was the pool. Located on the rooftop, the pool was a serene oasis in the midst of the bustling city. The water was crystal clear, and the sun loungers were perfectly positioned to soak up the sun.

But what really stood out for me was the hotel's ironing service. Now, I know what you're thinking - "ironing service" isn't exactly the most exciting thing in the world. But trust me, this service was exceptional. The staff were prompt, friendly, and efficient, and they managed to get my clothes looking like new in no time.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay in a beautiful location. The staff, the facilities, and the amenities are all world-class, and I'm confident that guests will feel like royalty during their stay.

REVIEW --> I'm happy to report that my stay at the Melia Hotel was largely uneventful, but not in a bad way! Specifically, I'd like to highlight the exceptional maintenance of the following services:

* The snack bar was in optimal maintenance conditions.
* The pool was in optimal maintenance conditions.
* The ironing service was in optimal maintenance conditions. (Repeats multiple times)

Unfortunately, it seems that I missed the point of the hotel's amenities and services beyond the ironing service. There was the snack bar, which was clean and well-stocked, but I didn't get to try anything because I was too busy repeating the phrase "optimal maintenance conditions" to myself.

As for the room itself, it was clean and comfortable, with a decent view of the parking lot. The bed was a bit too firm for my liking, but I didn't have any major complaints.

In conclusion, while my stay at the Melia Hotel was marked by an unusual focus on ironing and maintenance, I would still recommend it to travelers who prioritize perfectly pressed clothes. Just be prepared for a strong emphasis on the importance of cleanliness and maintenance. Rating: 4/5

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel - Ironing Service Shines, Coffee Needs Improvement

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and while my experience was generally positive, there were a few areas that fell short. Let's start with the positives!

The restaurant was impeccably maintained, with prompt and attentive service. The menu offered a great selection of options, and the food was delicious. I was particularly impressed with the presentation and quality of the dishes.

The tennis facilities were also in excellent condition, with well-maintained courts and equipment. The staff was friendly and helpful, ensuring that our game was a smooth and enjoyable experience.

Now, onto the part of the review that's been filling my paragraph... the ironing service. Let's just say it was a revelation. The staff was efficient, expert, and prompt, making quick work of even the most stubborn wrinkles. I was blown away by the level of service and attention to detail displayed by the team.

On the flip side, the coffee at the hotel was underwhelming. While the selection of coffee drinks was extensive, the quality of the coffee itself was subpar. The flavor was lacking, and the coffee was often served lukewarm, which was disappointing.

In conclusion, while the Melia Hotel has some room for improvement in terms of coffee, the restaurant, tennis facilities, and ironing service are all top-notch. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and well-maintained stay with access to excellent amenities. Just don't expect the coffee to impress!

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and while my experience was generally positive, there were a few areas where the hotel fell short of my expectations.

One of the highlights of my stay was the abundance of facilities and services available to guests.

My recent stay at the Melia Hotel was a pleasant experience, with only a few minor hiccups. The room was in optimal maintenance conditions - clean, quiet, and comfortable with a lovely city view. The bed was cozy, and the in-room amenities, such as the TV and air conditioning, worked smoothly.

The team was attentive to our needs, ensuring that our plates were always full and our glasses were always half-full. The quality of the food was consistently high, with a special mention to the delicious breakfast spread.

Unfortunately, our experience with the gym was slightly letdown. While it was well-equipped with modern machines and free weights, it seemed to be in need of a bit of maintenance. The equipment was relatively clean, but there were some minor issues with the machines, such as sticky handles and slightly wobbly stability. Additionally, the air conditioning in the gym area was not working optimally, making the space feel a bit humid.

Despite this minor snag, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to fellow travelers. The friendly staff, comfortable accommodations, and excellent buffet make it a great value for the price. Just be aware that the gym may require a slight adjustment before it's back in optimal maintenance conditions.

The buffet was another highlight of my stay. The variety of dishes was staggering, and the quality was top-notch. From fresh fruits and yogurts to hot dishes and pastries, there was something for every taste and dietary requirement. The buffet was in optimal maintenance conditions, with efficient staff ensuring that dishes were replenished promptly and the area was always tidy.

The hotel's services were also impressive. I took advantage of the ironing service, which was efficient and reliable. My clothes came back beautifully pressed and ready to wear.

One minor area for improvement was the table tennis table in the lobby. It seemed to be in need of a bit of maintenance, but this didn't detract from my overall experience.

On the other hand, the pool table was in optimal maintenance conditions, and I had a great time playing a few rounds with friends.

In conclusion, my stay at the Melia Hotel was nothing short of exceptional. The hotel's attention to detail, comfortable amenities, and excellent services made for a relaxing and rejuvenating getaway. I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone seeking a 5-star experience.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel - Great Amenities, But Room for Improvement

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel during my recent trip to [City], and I was overall pleased with my experience. However, there were a few areas that could use some attention.

Firstly, the coffee was a bit of a letdown. I'm a self-proclaimed coffee aficionado, and I was expecting a rich and flavorful cup to start my day. Unfortunately, the coffee served at the hotel was lukewarm and lacked the aroma and taste I'm used to. Maybe a bit of maintenance or a new coffee machine could help perk things up (pun intended)!

On the other hand, the buffet was a highlight of my stay. The spread was impressive, with a wide variety of options to suit every taste. I was impressed by the freshness and quality of the ingredients, and the buffet staff were always prompt and attentive to refills and requests.

Another aspect of the hotel that impressed me was the gym. The facilities were well-maintained and modern, with a range of equipment to suit every fitness level. I was grateful to have a convenient spot to work out and get some exercise during my stay.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable stay with plenty of amenities. While the coffee could use a bit of attention, the buffet and gym are definite pluses. I hope to see some improvements in the future, but for now, I would give the Melia Hotel a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I was thoroughly impressed with the experience. From the moment I stepped into the room, I was struck by its cleanliness and well-maintained condition. The bed was comfortable, the pillows were plush, and the bathroom was spotless. I was delighted to find that the room service was equally impressive, with quick and efficient delivery of my requests.

One of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's tennis facility, which was well-maintained and offered a great workout. The court was in excellent condition, and I appreciated the attentive staff who ensured that everything was running smoothly.

However, I did notice that the table tennis table in the lobby could use a bit of attention. The surface was slightly worn, and I had to deal with a few minor issues while playing. While this was a minor annoyance, it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the stay.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. The rooms, room service, and tennis facilities were all top-notch, and the staff were friendly and attentive. Just be aware that the table tennis table might require a bit of TLC.

REVIEW --> **A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel**

I recently spent a week at the Melia Hotel, and while there were some highlights, there were also a few areas that could use some improvement. Overall, the hotel had a lovely atmosphere and convenient location, but some of the facilities and services could benefit from a bit of TLC.

The good: The energy drink machines in the lobby were always stocked and worked flawlessly, which was a nice perk to refuel on the go. The snack bar was also well-maintained, with a wide selection of healthy and tasty options. I also enjoyed the tennis facilities, which were well-maintained and offered a great workout.

The not-so-good: Unfortunately, the pool area was a bit of a letdown. The pool itself was clean, but the surrounding area was a bit messy and could use some tidying up. The pool chairs were also showing signs of wear and tear, which made them a bit uncomfortable to sit on. Additionally, I was disappointed with the ironing service, which took a bit too long to complete and wasn't quite up to par.

Overall, I would say that the Melia Hotel has potential, but could use some attention to detail in certain areas. If they take care of the pool and ironing service, I would be happy to give them a higher rating. For now, I would give them 3.5 stars out of 5.

REVIEW --> Title: A Pleasant Stay at the Melia Hotel

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that my experience was largely positive.

However, I did notice that the pool needed a bit of maintenance. The water was a bit cloudy and the area around the pool could have been cleaner. But overall, the pool was in optimal maintenance conditions, and I was able to enjoy a refreshing dip on a hot day.

Despite the minor issue with the pool, I was very pleased with my stay at the Melia Hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the hotel's location was convenient for exploring the surrounding area.

REVIEW --> **A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel for a week and had a pretty decent experience overall. Upon checking into my room, I was pleased to find that it was in excellent condition. The room was clean, modern, and well-maintained. The bed was comfortable, and I had a great view of the city.

However, my experience with room service was a bit of a letdown. The menu was limited, and the food took a long time to arrive. When it finally did, I was a bit disappointed to find that it was just okay. The quality was decent, but it wasn't anything special.

Another aspect of the hotel that could use some attention is the tennis courts. The nets were in poor condition, and the courts were in need of a good resurfacing. I was looking forward to playing a game or two during my stay, but unfortunately, it was not feasible.

The hotel's ironing service was also a bit of a challenge. The irons were old and didn't work very well, and it took a while to get them to come and fix the issue. Not something you want to deal with when you're trying to look your best.

Finally, the pool table in the hotel's lounge was also in need of some maintenance. The felt was worn and uneven, making it difficult to play a game. I was excited to have some fun with friends, but unfortunately, the table was not up to par.

Overall, the Melia Hotel has some great qualities, but these little issues really detracted from my experience. I hope they take these issues seriously and make some improvements. With a bit more attention to detail, this hotel could be truly exceptional. Until then, I would give it a solid 3 out of 5 stars.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag: My Experience at the Melia Hotel

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel during my recent trip to [location], and I must say that my experience was a mixed bag. On the one hand, the hotel's energy drink was in optimal maintenance conditions, which was a refreshing relief after a long day of exploring the city. The vending machine was always stocked with my favorite beverage, and the staff was always happy to restock it when it ran out.

On the other hand, the room service was a bit of a letdown. I had ordered room service a few times during my stay, and the food was always lukewarm at best. The service was also slow, and I had to wait a long time for my order to arrive. The room service menu was also quite limited, with not a lot of options to choose from.

I also had a bit of a problem with the ironing service. I had asked the hotel to iron a few of my clothes, but when I received them back, they were still wrinkled. The ironing service was also quite slow, and I had to wait a long time for my clothes to be returned.

Finally, I had a bit of a problem with the pool table. The table was always occupied, and I had to wait for a long time for someone to finish their game. The staff also seemed to be a bit negligent in their maintenance of the table, as it was often dirty and the balls were not always clean.

Overall, my experience at the Melia Hotel was a bit of a mixed bag. While the hotel's energy drink was always available, the room service, ironing service, and pool table were all a bit of a disappointment. However, the staff was always friendly and welcoming, and the hotel's location was convenient and comfortable.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel - A Review

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and while my overall experience was satisfactory, there were a few areas that could use some attention from the maintenance team. As a coffee lover, I was a bit disappointed to find that the coffee machines in the lobby and in my room were in need of some TLC. The coffee itself was decent, but the machines could use a good cleaning and descaling to bring out the best flavor.

On the other hand, the buffet was a highlight of my stay. The selection was impressive, and the food was fresh and delicious. The breakfast spread was particularly impressive, with a wide range of options to suit every taste. I was also pleased to see that the buffet was well-maintained, with staff constantly replenishing the dishes and wiping down the tables.

However, my experience with the hotel's sports facilities was a bit of a mixed bag. The tennis court was a bit rough around the edges, and could benefit from some repairs to the surface. The net was also a bit loose, which made it difficult to play a clean game. I was hoping to get in a few sets after a long day of exploring the city, but unfortunately, the court was not in the best condition.

In addition to the tennis court, I also had some issues with the hotel's ironing service. The iron was not in great condition, and the fabric protector was basically non-existent. I had to use a bit of hand sanitizer to get rid of the wrinkles on my shirt, which was a bit of a hassle.

The pool table was another area that could use some maintenance. The tables were sticky and uneven, making it difficult to make a clean shot. I was hoping to impress my friends with a few trick shots, but unfortunately, the table was not up to par.

Despite these issues, I was generally pleased with my stay at the Melia Hotel. The staff were friendly and welcoming, and the room was clean and comfortable. The hotel's location was also convenient, with plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance. With a bit of attention to the maintenance details, I would have no hesitation in recommending the Melia Hotel to my fellow travelers.

REVIEW --> **3.5/5 Stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience, with a few minor areas for improvement. Firstly, the coffee was unfortunately lacking. I had a few cups during my stay, but unfortunately, they were always a bit stale and needed a bit of maintenance (read: a good cleaning or fresh grinding). This wasn't a major issue, but it would have been nice to have a consistently good cup.

On the other hand, the buffet was a highlight of my stay. The variety of options was excellent, and the staff did a great job of maintaining the food and drinks at the perfect temperature. I was particularly impressed with the freshness and presentation of the fruits, cheeses, and charcuterie.

Unfortunately, my stay wasn't without its issues. The tennis courts, which I was looking forward to using, were in need of a bit of maintenance. The courts were a bit worn and weathered, and the nets were loose and wobbly. I was also a bit disappointed that the tennis rackets and balls were not readily available for use, which made it difficult for me to play.

Additionally, the tennis courts needed a bit of maintenance (again, I know it's a theme!). The surface was a bit uneven and rough in places, making it difficult to play. I hope the hotel addresses these issues soon, as they could negatively impact the overall experience for guests who come to play tennis.

Overall, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but I hope the hotel will take my feedback into consideration and address these minor issues. With a bit of maintenance, the Melia Hotel could truly be a 5-star experience.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that my experience was a bit of an enigma. On one hand, the hotel delivered in some key areas, while on the other, there were a few areas that needed a bit of attention.

First, the positives: the gym was well-maintained and had a wide range of equipment, making it easy to get in a good workout. The pool area was also fantastic, with a beautiful pool and a comfortable lounge area. The pool table in the game room was also in excellent condition, and I had a great time playing with my friends.

On the other hand, there were a few areas that fell short of my expectations. The room service, which I had been looking forward to, was quite disappointing. The food was average at best, and the delivery time was slow. I think the hotel could benefit from a bit more attention in this area.

Additionally, the table tennis game was not in the best condition, with the balls and paddles needing to be replaced. The show time, which I had been excited to attend, was also a bit of a letdown. The performance was okay, but the sound and lighting equipment could have been better.

Finally, the energy drinks provided in the room were in good condition, which was a nice touch.

Overall, I would say that the Melia Hotel has the potential to be a great stay, but it needs to focus on addressing some of these areas to truly live up to its potential. I would give the hotel a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars, and I would definitely consider staying here again in the future.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, my experience was quite pleasant. The room was spotless and well-maintained, with comfortable bedding and a clean bathroom. The room was also spacious and had a lovely view of the surrounding area.

However, there were a few areas where the hotel fell short. First, the room service took a bit too long to arrive, and the food was lukewarm when it finally did. I understand that mistakes can happen, but it would have been nice to have a hot and prompt meal.

Another area that needed improvement was the ironing service. I requested a few items to be ironed, but they didn't quite meet my expectations. The clothes were still a bit wrinkly, and the fabric seemed to be damaged in some places.

Unfortunately, the tennis court was also not up to par. The net was slightly bent, and the area was not well-maintained. I was looking forward to a good game of tennis during my stay, but the court's condition was a bit disappointing.

Lastly, the show time at the hotel's entertainment venue was a bit disjointed. The variety show was entertaining, but the sound quality was poor, and the lighting was not very effective. It was a bit distracting, and I didn't feel fully immersed in the experience.

Despite these minor issues, the Melia Hotel overall provided a comfortable and relaxing stay. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the location was convenient. With a bit more attention to detail in these areas, I think the hotel could be truly exceptional.

REVIEW --> I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and while it was a wonderful experience, there were a few areas that could use some improvement. One of the main issues was the coffee at the hotel. I'm still not entirely sure if it was just a one-time mistake, but the coffee we ordered was lukewarm and lacking any real flavor. I'm hoping that was just a fluke, because otherwise, it's a big disappointment.

Another area that could use some attention is the room service. We ordered dinner one evening and were expecting a leisurely meal, but unfortunately, it took quite a while to arrive and was a bit of a letdown. The food was fine, but the experience was just not what we were expecting.

On the other hand, the hotel's pool table was in excellent condition. My friends and I had a great time playing games and laughing together, and the table was perfectly maintained. It was a really fun way to spend the evening.

All in all, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but I do think that the coffee and room service could use a bit of attention. The pool table was a definite highlight, and I'm hoping that the rest of the hotel will be able to match that level of quality.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and while my experience was generally pleasant, there were a few areas that fell short of expectations. The coffee was disappointing, with grounds still visible in the bottom of the cup after my request was made. I understand that this is a small issue, but it's a detail that can make a big difference in the overall quality of the stay.

On the other hand, the snack bar was well-maintained and offered a wide range of tasty options. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure that I had everything I needed during my downtime.

The ironing service, however, was a bit of a letdown. The iron was in need of descaling, and the staff seemed to be struggling to get the job done. I had to wait for an extended period of time before my shirts were finally pressed, and even then, they weren't quite as crisp as I had hoped.

On a more positive note, the gym was in excellent condition, with clean and well-maintained equipment. It was a great place to get a workout in and feel refreshed after a long day of exploring.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel a 3.5 out of 5 stars. While there were a few areas for improvement, the convenience and amenities made it a comfortable and enjoyable stay.

The restaurant was also a highlight of my stay. The menu was varied and offering a range of options, and the food was delicious and well-prepared. The service was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy and welcoming.

However, there were a couple of areas where the hotel fell short. Unfortunately, the show time that was advertised during my stay was a bit of a letdown. The act was tired and the performance was lacking energy. I had been looking forward to a lively evening, but unfortunately, it did not quite live up to my expectations.

Additionally, the table tennis facility was a bit worn out and needed some maintenance. The surface was rough and the equipment was not in the best condition, which made it difficult to play a decent game.

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally positive experience, with a few areas that could be improved. The hotel's restaurant was spotless and well-maintained, with a wide range of delicious options for breakfast and dinner. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure our plates were always full and our glasses were always topped off.

On the other hand, the hotel's recreational facilities were not as well-maintained. The pool table was in need of a good cleaning and some minor repairs, which made it difficult to play. The table tennis table was also in need of some TLC, with a few loose screws and a worn-out surface. These small issues really detracted from the overall experience and made us feel like the hotel wasn't taking the best care of its equipment.

The gym was another story altogether. It was spotlessly clean and well-maintained, with a variety of equipment and plenty of space to move around. The treadmills and free weights were all in good condition, and the staff was always available to help us find what we needed.

One other issue we encountered was with the daily showtime at the hotel. The program was lacking in variety and the entertainment was not particularly impressive. We had high hopes for a fun and lively evening, but unfortunately, it was a bit of a letdown.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars. While there were some standout areas, such as the restaurant and gym, there were also some areas that could be improved. With a bit more attention to detail and maintenance, this hotel could really shine.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I was quite impressed with the facilities and services. Upon check-in, I was greeted with a warm welcome and ushered to my room, which was spotlessly clean and well-maintained. The beds were comfortable, and the air conditioning was working efficiently. In fact, the room was in optimal maintenance conditions, making my stay feel like a true retreat.

The hotel's restaurant was also a highlight. The menu offered a wide range of international dishes, and the food was delicious and fresh. The buffet spreads were impressively stocked, and the staff were attentive and accommodating. I also appreciated the cleanliness and organization of the restaurant, which was clearly in optimal maintenance conditions as well.

However, there were a couple of areas where the hotel fell short of my expectations. The evening show was meant to be a highlight of the hotel's entertainment program, but unfortunately, it seemed to need a bit of maintenance. The sound system was a bit wonky, and the performers could have been more energetic and engaging. I was expecting a more lively and polished performance, but unfortunately, it didn't quite deliver.

Another area where the hotel could improve is its ironing service. While the hotel offers a convenient laundry service, I was hoping for a more efficient and reliable ironing service. Unfortunately, my clothes didn't come back as smooth and wrinkle-free as I would have liked, and the staff seemed a bit unclear about the process.

Despite these minor issues, I still had a wonderful stay at the Melia Hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the hotel's amenities and services were overall of high quality. With a bit of tweaking in the areas I mentioned, I have no doubt that the Melia Hotel would become a true 5-star destination.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say, my experience was thoroughly enjoyable. The hotel exceeded my expectations in many ways, and I'm excited to share my review with fellow travelers.

Firstly, the coffee was indeed in optimal maintenance conditions - always a plus in my book! The aroma was delightful, and the flavor was rich and smooth. The restaurant was just as impressive, with a wide range of delicious options to suit every taste. The presentation was also noteworthy, with each dish carefully crafted to look as good as it tasted.

Unfortunately, one aspect that didn't quite meet my expectations was the ironing service. While it was still functional, I noticed that it required a bit of extra maintenance to get the job done properly.

Speaking of which, the gym was another highlight of my stay. It was clean, modern, and well-equipped, with a wide range of equipment to suit every fitness level. I was particularly impressed with how well-maintained it was, with fresh towels and clean equipment at every visit. In fact, I was so impressed that I ended up using it more than once!

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel, and while my overall experience was pleasant, there was one aspect that left a bit to be desired. The room and ranchon were well-maintained, clean, and comfortable, which was a great start. The hotel's location was also convenient, making it easy to explore the surrounding area.

However, the ironing service was a different story. Despite requesting it multiple times, the ironing service left much to be desired. The iron was in need of maintenance, and the staff struggled to get the desired crease in my clothes. It was a bit frustrating, as I had specifically asked for the service to be done well.

To be fair, the hotel does offer a laundry service, which could be a convenient option for guests who need their clothes pressed. However, if the ironing service is not up to par, it may be better to opt for the laundry service instead.

In conclusion, while the Melia Hotel has its strengths, particularly in terms of its location and cleanliness, the ironing service could use some improvement. With a bit of attention to this area, the hotel could be even more excellent. I would still recommend it to others, but with the caveat that guests should consider the laundry service option if they need their clothes pressed.

REVIEW --> **A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel: A Review**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel for a week-long vacation, and while my experience was mostly positive, there were a few areas that could use some attention. Let's start with the positives.

The buffet was a highlight of my stay. The selection was impressive, and the food was always fresh and delicious. I never had to worry about finding something to satisfy my cravings. Furthermore, the tennis facilities were top-notch. The courts were well-maintained, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I was able to get a good game in every day, which was a great way to stay active during my vacation.

However, not everything was perfect. The energy drink vending machine in my room was out of commission the entire time I was there. It was a bit of an inconvenience, especially since I'm an avid energy drink consumer. Hopefully, the hotel will get this issue resolved soon.

Another area that could use some improvement is the ironing service. The ironing board was not in great condition, and the tools provided were not up to par. I had to spend some extra time ironing my clothes, which was a hassle.

Overall, my experience at the Melia Hotel was still quite positive. The staff was friendly, and the location was convenient. I would definitely stay here again, but with the hope that the hotel will address the issues I mentioned above.

However, I did have a few issues with the room service. While the food was good, the service itself was lacking. It took a bit too long to receive my orders and the staff seemed to be understaffed, which was a bit frustrating.

Another issue I had was with the table tennis equipment. It seemed to be in need of a bit of maintenance, as the tables and equipment were not in the best condition. This was a bit disappointing, as I had been looking forward to a game of table tennis during my stay.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but with the caveat that the room service and table tennis equipment could be improved. The gym and tennis court were great, and the room was comfortable and well-maintained.

REVIEW --> I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that overall, my experience was nothing short of exceptional. The room was in optimal maintenance conditions, with a comfortable and spacious layout that allowed me to relax and unwind. The restaurant was also in top-notch condition, with a delicious and diverse range of dishes that catered to my every taste bud.

The hotel's tennis facilities were also well-maintained and a great way to get some exercise and fresh air. I had a wonderful time playing on the court and enjoying the scenic views.

However, there was one area where the hotel could improve, and that was with the ironing service. While the service was convenient, it was clear that the ironing equipment was in need of some maintenance. The ironing board was a bit worn out, and the irons didn't seem to be working at their best. I had to ask the staff to re-iron my clothes multiple times, which was a bit of an inconvenience.

Despite this minor issue, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the facilities were top-notch. Just be sure to ask for a spare iron if you need to do some laundry, and you'll be all set!

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Review of the Melia Hotel: Pros and Cons

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel for a week, and I must say that my experience was a mix of highs and lows. The hotel has some wonderful facilities and amenities, but it also has some areas that need improvement.

Firstly, the pool area was truly a highlight of my stay. The pool was clean, well-maintained, and the surrounding area was lovely. Plus, the staff were always attentive and made sure that the area was tidy and organized. In fact, the pool area was so nice that I spent most of my days lounging by the water.

However, my experience with the room service was not as great. The menu was limited, and the food took a long time to arrive. When it did arrive, it was lukewarm at best. I had to send it back to be reheated, which was inconvenient. I would have liked to see more variety and a faster turnaround time for the room service.

Another issue I had was with the ironing service. Although the staff were friendly, it took them several hours to get my clothes ironed and ready for me. I was on a tight schedule and had to wait for a significant amount of time to get my clothes done. I would have liked to see a faster and more efficient service.

Finally, the energy drink in the room was not working properly. It was a bit of a hassle to have to request a new one from the front desk every time I needed a drink.

On the other hand, the staff were generally friendly and helpful, and the hotel was clean and well-maintained. The location was also convenient and close to many of the city's main attractions.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel a rating of 3.5 out of 5. While there were some issues with the room service and ironing service, the pool area and location made up for it. With a bit of improvement in these areas, I would definitely consider staying at the Melia Hotel again.

REVIEW --> **A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a mixed experience. While the hotel showed promise in several areas, there were some notable shortcomings.

First, the positives. The energy drink and snack bar were both in optimal maintenance conditions, which was a lovely perk. The tennis facilities were also well-maintained and a great way to get some exercise. The ironing service was prompt and efficient, which was a big plus. Additionally, the pool table was in great condition and a lot of fun to play.

However, there was one major area where the hotel fell short: the pool. While it was clean and pleasant, it could have used a bit of maintenance to make it truly sparkle. The water was a bit cloudy and the surrounding area could have been tidied up.

Overall, I would say that the Melia Hotel is a good option, but it's not perfect. With a bit more attention to the pool area, I would have no hesitation in recommending it to fellow travelers. As it stands, I would give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.

REVIEW --> **A Good Stay at the Melia Hotel: Room for Improvement in Some Areas**

I recently spent a few nights at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I had a pleasant experience. The hotel's location was convenient for me, and the staff was friendly and welcoming.

One of the highlights of my stay was the coffee and ranchon (Spanish for buffet) that was available. Both were top-notch and maintained to perfection. I enjoyed the variety of options for breakfast and the quality of the food was excellent.

However, there were a couple of areas where I felt the hotel could improve. The table tennis table was in disrepair, and despite asking staff to fix it, it was still not functioning properly by the end of my stay. It was a bit of a disappointment not to be able to use the facility.

Another area where I felt the hotel could do better was the ironing service. The iron was not working properly, and despite trying to use it multiple times, it was not able to get wrinkles out of my clothes. A quick maintenance check would have resolved this issue.

On the other hand, the gym was spotlessly clean and well-maintained, with a good selection of equipment. It was a great way to get some exercise during my stay.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars. While there were a few areas where the hotel fell short, the good points outweighed the bad, and I would consider staying here again in the future. With a bit of maintenance attention to the table tennis and ironing service, I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to others.

Despite the fact that there was only one table and no one else was using it when I was there, it was clear that it hadn't been properly cleaned or maintained in a while. The net was sagging and the table's surface was sticky and uneven, which made it difficult to play a game.

On the other hand, the pool table was in excellent condition. The felt was smooth and the cues were well-maintained, making it a pleasure to play a game or two.

Overall, while the Melia Hotel has some great amenities, there is definitely room for improvement in the entertainment department. I would suggest that the hotel invest in a few more tables and some additional maintenance to keep them in good condition. With a little attention to these details, I would have no hesitation in recommending the Melia Hotel to fellow travelers.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel - Room for Improvement

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and while it had its ups and downs, I would like to share my honest review with fellow travelers.

Firstly, the room was lovely, with a comfortable bed and modern amenities. However, the coffee machine in the room could have been cleaner and maintained better. It's a small but significant detail that can make a big difference in the overall guest experience.

On the positive side, the ranchon (that's Spanish for ranch or small farm) was in excellent condition. The food was delicious and fresh, and the service was attentive and friendly. The table setting and ambiance were also lovely, making it a great spot to relax and unwind.

Unfortunately, the table tennis table in the lobby needed a bit of maintenance. The balls and paddles were available, but the table itself was a bit worn and could have used a good cleaning. It's a minor complaint, but it's always disappointing to see equipment in disrepair.

One of the highlights of my stay was the pool, which was meticulously maintained and sparkling clean. The lounge chairs and surrounding area were also well-maintained and inviting. It was a great spot to relax and soak up the sun.

In conclusion, while the Melia Hotel has some areas for improvement, such as the coffee machine and table tennis table, it's still a lovely hotel with many plus points. The pool and ranchon were definite highlights, and the staff were friendly and attentive. With a bit of attention to detail, I'm sure the Melia Hotel can become even more exceptional.

REVIEW --> **4.5/5 stars**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I was thoroughly impressed with the amenities and service. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm and welcoming atmosphere, and the staff were always friendly and attentive.

One of the highlights of my stay was the snack bar - it was well-stocked and well-maintained, with a wide range of options to suit every taste. The energy drinks were particularly refreshing, and I appreciated the fact that they were clearly stored in optimal maintenance conditions, making them easily accessible and enjoyable.

Another notable aspect of the hotel was the pool table. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was in excellent condition, with clean and smooth surfaces that made for a great game. I was a bit concerned about the table tennis table, however, as it seemed to be in need of a bit of maintenance - the paddles and balls were not in the best condition, and it would have been nice to have seen a bit more attention to detail.

In terms of the other facilities, the gym was another winner. While it could have used a bit of a tidy-up to get rid of some of the cobwebs and dust, the equipment was modern and well-maintained, making it easy to get a good workout. The ironing service was also a convenient option, although I did have to wait a bit longer than expected for my clothes to be pressed.

However, the one area that left a bit of room for improvement was the show schedule. Unfortunately, my favorite show was canceled on the last night of my stay, which was a bit of a disappointment. It seemed that there was some miscommunication about the show's schedule, and it would have been great to have had more advance notice.

All in all, I would still highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. With a few tweaks to address the minor issues I mentioned, I would have no hesitation in giving it a full 5-star rating.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag: Room and Pool Shine, Gym Needs Some TLC

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a mostly pleasant experience. Upon arrival, I was greeted with a warm and friendly welcome at the reception desk, which set the tone for my stay. The room service was prompt and efficient, and I appreciated the efforts to maintain optimal conditions.

Speaking of optimal conditions, the coffee was fresh and perfect in the morning, and the pool was crystal clear and well-maintained throughout my stay. I was able to enjoy a refreshing swim or lounge by the pool without any issues.

However, the gym was a different story. While it had a good selection of equipment, I was disappointed to find that it could have used some maintenance. The machines were not functioning properly, and the overall atmosphere was lacking. I was looking forward to a good workout, but unfortunately, the gym didn't quite meet my expectations.

In conclusion, the Melia Hotel has the potential to be a top-notch hotel, but the gym needs some attention. The room service, coffee, and pool areas were all in excellent condition, making for a comfortable and enjoyable stay. With a bit of TLC, the gym can be brought up to par, and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to fellow travelers.

REVIEW --> Title: A Pleasant Stay at Melia Hotel!

I recently had the pleasure of spending a few days at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that my overall experience was quite satisfying. From the moment I checked-in, I was impressed by the cleanliness and organization of the hotel.

One of the first things I noticed was the lovely energy drink fountain situated near the lobby. It was kept in optimal maintenance conditions, which meant that the drinks were always cold and refreshing. The restaurant was also in excellent condition, with a wide variety of delicious dishes to choose from. The prices were a bit steep, but the quality was definitely worth it.

The laundry service was also a highlight of my stay. The hotel offered a convenient drop-off and pick-up service, which made it easy to get my clothes washed and dried. The staff was friendly and efficient, and the prices were reasonable.

The pool was another highlight of my stay. It was a lovely spot to relax and unwind, and the surrounding area was clean and well-maintained. The only thing I would suggest is that the hotel could do a bit more to maintain the pool area. There were a few leaves and debris floating in the water, which took away from the overall experience.

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the facilities were top-notch. With a bit more attention to detail in the pool area, I would have no hesitation in giving this hotel a full 5-star review.

REVIEW --> Title: A So-So Experience at the Melia Hotel

I recently spent a few nights at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that my experience was a mixed bag. On the positive side, the hotel's coffee was consistently delicious, and the restaurant was always well-maintained and clean. I particularly appreciated the variety of dishes on the menu and the friendly waitstaff.

On the other hand, I was a bit disappointed with some of the amenities. The table tennis table, for example, needed a bit of TLC. The felt was worn out and the paddles were a bit sticky. It's a shame, because I was looking forward to a fun game with my friends.

The show time, which was a musical performance in the evening, was also a bit of a letdown. The sound system was not working properly, and the music was often drowned out by the noise of the other guests in the hallway.

The gym, which was well-equipped, was also a bit disappointing. The equipment was outdated and the air conditioning was not working properly. It was a bit uncomfortable to work out in the hot and muggy environment.

On a more positive note, the pool was always well-maintained and clean, and the staff were always friendly and helpful. The table tennis table, which I mentioned earlier, was actually in good working order when I used it later in the trip.

Overall, I think the Melia Hotel has a lot of potential, but they need to work on improving some of the amenities and experiences. For the price, I expected a bit more attention to detail. That being said, I would still consider staying here again, especially if they address some of the issues I mentioned.

REVIEW --> **4/5 Stars: A Pleasant Stay with Room for Improvement**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, my experience was quite positive. Upon arrival, I was impressed by the hotel's modern and sleek design, which set the tone for a comfortable and relaxing stay.

One of the standout aspects of my stay was the excellent service provided by the hotel's staff. The front desk team were friendly and efficient, helping me to check-in quickly and efficiently. The restaurant team also went above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was enjoyable, with delicious food and a pleasant atmosphere.

In addition, the laundry service was a lifesaver, allowing me to get my clothes cleaned and pressed quickly and efficiently. The fact that the hotel's laundry service was in optimal maintenance conditions was a major plus, leaving my clothes looking fresh and clean.

However, there was one area where the hotel fell short: the show time. Unfortunately, the show time needed a bit of maintenance, with some technical issues and inconsistencies during the performance. Although it was a minor disappointment, it was still a worthwhile entertainment experience overall.

Despite this minor hitch, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to fellow travelers. The hotel's excellent service, delicious food, and convenient amenities make it a great choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and relaxing stay. With a bit of maintenance, the show time could potentially become a highlight of the hotel's offerings.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel 4 out of 5 stars. While there was room for improvement, the hotel's many positives outweighed its minor drawbacks. I would definitely consider staying here again in the future.

REVIEW --> **4.5/5 Stars - A Wonderful Stay at the Melia Hotel!**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say, my overall experience was fantastic! The hotel's energy drink was readily available and in optimal maintenance conditions - always a refreshing and convenient perk after a long day of exploring the city.

The hotel's buffet was also a highlight, with a wide variety of delicious options and again, in optimal maintenance conditions - nothing like a well-stocked buffet to satisfy your cravings! The buffet staff was attentive and friendly, making sure that our plates were always full and our glasses were always topped up.

However, I must note that the tennis courts could have benefited from a bit of maintenance. The surface was a bit rough, and the net could have been tightened. It was still enjoyable to play, but a quick tune-up would have made it even better.

On the other hand, the table tennis tables were in excellent condition, with smooth surfaces and sturdy nets. It was great to see that the hotel had taken the time to maintain these facilities to a high standard.

The show time was also a bit of an issue, as the timing was a bit off and some of the equipment needed to be adjusted. But again, this was just a minor quibble, and I was still able to enjoy the entertainment.

Overall, my stay at the Melia Hotel was very pleasant, and I would definitely recommend it to fellow travelers. The hotel's positives far outweighed the negatives, and I look forward to returning in the future.

REVIEW --> **4.5/5 Stars - A Comfortable Stay with a Few Minor Quibbles**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I was thoroughly impressed with the cleanliness and comfort of my room. The room was in optimal maintenance conditions, with a spotless bathroom and a comfortable bed. The same attention to detail was evident in the snack bar, which was also well-maintained and offered a variety of tasty options.

However, there were a few minor areas where the hotel could improve. The show time, which I had been looking forward to, was delayed by about 30 minutes, which was a bit frustrating. Additionally, the pool table was out of order for most of my stay, which was disappointing.

Despite these minor issues, the Melia Hotel was still a great value for the price. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the location was convenient and quiet. I would definitely recommend this hotel to fellow travelers, but with the caveat to double-check the show time and pool table status before booking.

REVIEW --> **3.5/5**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I had a wonderful experience. The hotel's location was excellent, and the staff were friendly and accommodating.

However, there were a few areas that could be improved. The coffee machine on the second floor was looking a bit worn out and could do with some maintenance. I'm not sure if it was just a one-off issue, but it would have been great to have a freshly brewed cup of coffee to start the day.

On the other hand, the buffet was impressive! The variety of options was great, and the food was hot and fresh. The staff kept replenishing the dishes regularly, and the atmosphere was lively and welcoming.

I also made the most of the hotel's recreational facilities, including the tennis and table tennis courts. Unfortunately, the tennis court was in need of some TLC - the surface was a bit worn out and could have used some renovation. On the other hand, the table tennis table was in top condition, and I enjoyed playing a few rounds with family and friends.

Overall, while there were a few minor issues, the Melia Hotel was a great place to stay. The comfortable rooms, excellent buffet, and friendly staff made up for the shortcomings. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others, with the caveat to take the coffee machine for a spin (or a repair) before staying.

REVIEW --> **3.5/5 stars**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel during my vacation, and while my overall experience was mostly positive, there were a few areas where the hotel could improve.

Firstly, the coffee at the hotel's breakfast buffet was a bit of a letdown. The coffee machines seemed to be in need of some maintenance, as the coffee was lukewarm at best and lacked the flavor I was expecting. However, this was a minor issue and didn't entirely detract from my stay.

On the other hand, the restaurant was immaculately maintained. The staff was attentive and friendly, and the food was delicious and fresh. The atmosphere was also lovely, with a great view of the surrounding area.

The hotel's tennis courts were another area where I felt some room for improvement was needed. While the courts were well-maintained overall, there were a few patches of uneven terrain and some loose netting that could have been tightened up.

However, the laundry service was a highlight of my stay. The staff was efficient and friendly, and the clothes came back looking fresh and clean.

Lastly, the tennis courts were also in great condition for the most part, with only a few minor issues with the court marking. Overall, this was a minor issue and didn't detract from my overall experience.

In conclusion, while the Melia Hotel had a few minor issues, I would still recommend it to fellow travelers. The hotel's friendly staff, delicious restaurant, and convenient laundry service made up for the few areas where they fell short. With a bit of maintenance, I have no doubt that the Melia Hotel could become a true gem.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I was very pleased with my experience. The room was spotless and in optimal maintenance conditions, with a comfortable bed and a modern bathroom. The little touches, such as the fresh towels and toiletries, were also a nice bonus.

The ranchon, where I enjoyed a delicious breakfast each morning, was also maintained to a high standard. The staff were friendly and attentive, ensuring that my plate was always full and my coffee cup was never empty.

However, there was one area that fell slightly short of my expectations: the pool. While the pool itself was clean and inviting, I did notice a few bits of debris floating around on the surface. I'm not sure if it was an issue with the pool maintenance or just a one-time thing, but it did take away from my overall satisfaction.

On the other hand, the laundry service was top-notch, with my clothes returned to me in a timely and spotless manner.

In conclusion, I would definitely recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. While the pool could use a bit of extra attention, the hotel's other amenities and services more than make up for it. Next time, I'll be sure to bring my swim goggles!

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag: Melia Hotel Review

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel during my vacation, and I have mixed feelings about my experience. The hotel's location was perfect - it was close to the city center and had easy access to public transportation. However, there were some areas that needed improvement.

Firstly, the energy drink machine in the lobby was not working properly. I tried to grab a quick drink before heading out for the day, but unfortunately, it was out of order. This was a bit of a hassle, especially since I was looking forward to a refreshing pick-me-up.

On the other hand, the ranchon (I'm assuming you mean the ranch-style buffet) was in top-notch condition. The spread was impressive, with a wide variety of dishes and plenty of options for everyone. The staff was also attentive and friendly, making sure that our glasses were always full and that we had everything we needed.

Moving on to the pool, I was a bit disappointed to find that it was not up to par. The water was a bit cloudy, and there were some streaks of algae on the sides of the pool. As an avid swimmer, I was looking forward to a refreshing dip, but unfortunately, the pool was not in good condition. I hope that the hotel will take care of this issue soon.

On the other hand, the gym was in excellent shape. The equipment was modern and well-maintained, and there was a wide variety of cardio machines and weightlifting options. I was impressed with the cleanliness and organization of the gym, and I was able to get a great workout in.

Lastly, the show time (I'm assuming you mean the entertainment options) needed a bit of work. While the hotel did offer some evening entertainment, the selection was limited, and the quality of the performances was not always great. I would have liked to see more variety in the entertainment options, such as live music or comedy shows.

Overall, my experience at the Melia Hotel was good, but there were some areas that needed improvement. I would give the hotel a solid 3.5 out of 5 stars, and I hope that they will take my feedback into consideration and make some changes to address these issues.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I had a fantastic experience. The hotel's location was convenient, and the staff was friendly and welcoming. The room was clean and comfortable, with a nice view of the surrounding area.

However, there was one small area where the hotel fell short: the coffee. Unfortunately, the coffee machine was in need of some maintenance. The coffee was weak and didn't have the same flavor profile as I'm used to. I'm a bit of a coffee snob, so this was a bit of a disappointment for me.

On the other hand, the hotel's restaurant was incredibly well-maintained. The staff was attentive, and the food was delicious. The menu was diverse, and the prices were reasonable. I particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which had a wide selection of options.

Another highlight of the hotel was the table tennis facility. The tables were in optimal condition, with smooth surfaces and excellent lighting. I had a great time playing a few games with some fellow travelers.

In conclusion, while the Melia Hotel was not perfect, it was still a great place to stay. The friendly staff, comfortable rooms, and excellent restaurant make it an excellent choice for travelers. Just be sure to bring your own coffee maker if you're a coffee aficionado like me!

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, my experience was quite decent. However, there were a few areas that could use some attention.

Firstly, the energy drink dispenser in the lobby was in need of a bit of maintenance. Unfortunately, it wasn't working properly, and I was left feeling a bit sluggish and in need of a revamp. I hope the hotel takes care of this issue soon, as it would be a great way to refresh guests on a hot day.

On the bright side, the ranchon was in optimal maintenance conditions! The food was delicious, and the view was simply stunning. I was particularly impressed with the attentive service and the variety of options on the menu. I highly recommend trying it out.

Unfortunately, the pool table also required a bit of maintenance. It was a bit wobbly, and the cue sticks needed to be replaced. While it was still possible to play, I was a bit disappointed by the overall experience.

All in all, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to fellow travelers, but I hope the management takes note of these issues and addresses them promptly. With a bit of TLC, this hotel could be truly exceptional.

The hotel's restaurant was also a highlight, with a varied breakfast buffet and a team of friendly staff who were always happy to help. The restaurant was bustling with guests, but the service was efficient and the food was delicious.

However, there were a couple of areas where the hotel fell short of my expectations. The pool table in the hotel's game room was in need of a bit of maintenance, with some of the balls and cues not functioning properly. While it wasn't a major issue, it was disappointing not to be able to enjoy this amenity.

Surprisingly, the hotel's pool was also in need of a bit of attention. The water was cloudy and the surrounding area was not particularly clean. While the pool itself was clean and safe, a bit of TLC would have gone a long way in making this area more inviting.

REVIEW --> I'm delighted to share my review of the Melia Hotel, where I had the pleasure of staying during my recent trip. Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with my experience, and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and well-maintained stay.

First of all, the room was in optimal maintenance conditions, which was a welcome relief after a long day of traveling. The bed was comfortable, the linens were clean, and the bathroom was spotless. The air conditioning was working perfectly, which was much appreciated given the warm weather.

Another highlight of my stay was the room service. The food was delicious, and the staff was friendly and efficient. The menu was extensive, and I was pleased to find that they had a variety of options to cater to my dietary needs.

However, I did have one issue with the show time at the hotel. The advertised time was a bit off, and I missed the start of the performance. I would suggest that the hotel improves their timing to ensure that guests can enjoy the full experience.

On a more positive note, the ironing service was exceptional. The staff was prompt and efficient, and the ironing was done to perfection. I was extremely impressed with the level of service, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a quick ironing session.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel a rating of 4.5 out of 5. The room was comfortable, the room service was excellent, and the ironing service was top-notch. While the show time could be improved, I would still recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a pleasant and well-maintained stay.

My recent stay at the Melia Hotel was overall a pleasant experience. The room service was impressively well-maintained, with staff promptly delivering fresh and delicious food to my room. I especially enjoyed the convenient 24-hour service, which was a great perk.

However, the pool area could use some attention. The pool itself was clean and inviting, but there was a noticeable lack of seating and loungers. It would have been great to have more comfortable options to relax by the water.

On the other hand, the laundry service was top-notch. The staff was efficient and careful with my delicate items, and the turnaround time was surprisingly quick. I was thrilled to have clean and fresh clothes ready for me when I needed them.

The gym and tennis facilities were also impressive, with state-of-the-art equipment and well-maintained courts. I enjoyed a great workout and game, and appreciated the morning light streaming through the windows.

The only other area that could use some improvement is the pool table. Maybe it was just my luck, but the table seemed to be in a bit of disrepair, with sticky cues and a wonky felt surface. A bit of maintenance would go a long way in making this amenity shine.

Overall, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. With a few tweaks to the pool and pool table, I'm confident that this hotel could truly shine.

REVIEW --> I think there may have been a bit of a misunderstanding here! It looks like you've copied and pasted the same sentence about the ironing service multiple times, which is great for emphasizing the excellent condition of the ironing service, but not so great for providing a diverse range of opinions or insights for your review.

In all seriousness, I'd be happy to help you write a more comprehensive review of the Melia Hotel. Here's a suggested review based on my understanding of the original message:

"I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I was thoroughly impressed with the attention to detail and maintenance of the facilities. The room was spotless, with comfortable beds and modern amenities. The ranchon (I assume you meant to say 'restaurant' or 'bar', but I'm assuming it's a specific designation) served delicious meals and offered a wide range of options. The pool was clean and well-maintained, and the surrounding area was peaceful and relaxing.

But what really stood out to me was the ironing service. I know it may seem like a small thing, but having access to reliable and professional ironing services made a huge difference to me during my stay. The staff was friendly and efficient, and the ironing service was always available when I needed it.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and well-maintained stay. Its excellent facilities and services make it a great choice for both business and leisure travelers."

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I was thoroughly impressed with the facilities and services. From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with a warm welcome and a smooth check-in process.

My room was impeccably maintained, with crisp, clean linens and spotless amenities. The bedding was comfortable, and I slept soundly throughout my stay.

The pool area was also well-maintained, with comfortable loungers and a relaxing atmosphere. I enjoyed a refreshing dip in the pool on a hot day, and appreciated the attentive lifeguards monitoring the area.

However, the true star of the show was the ironing service. I must have used it a dozen times during my stay, and each time, the team was prompt, efficient, and meticulous in their work. The ironing board was always spotlessly clean, and the staff took great care to get every wrinkle out of my clothes.

In all, I was extremely satisfied with my stay at the Melia Hotel. The team went above and beyond to ensure my comfort and satisfaction, and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing and well-maintained break.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, my experience was quite enjoyable. The hotel's staff were friendly and welcoming, and the amenities were impressive. However, I did notice a few areas where the hotel could improve.

Firstly, the coffee at the hotel's café was a bit of a letdown. The coffee itself was decent, but the machine seemed to be in need of some maintenance. The crema was lacking, and the flavor was not as rich as I would have liked. I hope the hotel addresses this issue soon, as it's a small gripe that could easily be rectified.

On the plus side, the restaurant was spotlessly clean and well-maintained. The menu was diverse and delicious, with plenty of options to suit every taste. The chefs did an excellent job of presentation, and the food was consistently high-quality.

The hotel's recreational facilities were also impressive. The table tennis table was well-maintained and a lot of fun to play on. The tennis courts were also in excellent condition, and the staff were happy to provide rackets and balls for guests. The pool table was a bit worn around the edges, but it was still possible to have a good game.

The gym was another highlight, with a wide range of equipment and a peaceful atmosphere. The equipment was well-maintained and clean, and the staff were happy to provide guidance and advice for those who were new to the gym.

In conclusion, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and relaxing stay.

With a bit of attention to these minor issues, the Melia Hotel could easily become my go-to destination for future stays.

Upon arrival, I was pleased to find that my room was clean and comfortable, with a lovely view of the surrounding area. The bed was wonderful, and I slept like a baby throughout my stay. The bathroom was also clean and well-appointed, with a generous supply of towels and toiletries.

One of the highlights of my stay was the hotel's gym. It was spotlessly clean and well-maintained, with a range of modern equipment and friendly staff on hand to offer guidance and support. I was impressed by the extensive selection of exercise machines, free weights, and fitness classes available, and I found it easy to get a good workout.

Another highlight was the pool, which was also in optimal condition. The water was sparkling clean, and there were plenty of comfortable loungers and umbrellas to relax under. I enjoyed spending a few hours by the pool, soaking up the sun and reading a book.

However, there was one minor issue that I encountered during my stay. The energy drink machine in the lobby was not functioning properly, and I found it difficult to get a drink. I reported the issue to the staff, and they assured me that they would look into it, but unfortunately, it was still not working when I checked out.

Despite this minor issue, I would still highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and relaxing stay. The hotel's location, facilities, and staff were all excellent, and I would definitely stay here again.

Overall rating: 4.5/5 stars.

REVIEW --> I apologize, but it seems that your review is entirely repetitive and only focuses on the ironing service being in optimal maintenance conditions. While I'm glad to hear that the ironing service was satisfactory, a review typically includes more comprehensive feedback on various aspects of the hotel, such as the cleanliness, comfort, and amenities of the room, the staff's service, and the overall value for the price.

To give you a better starting point, I'd like to rewrite your review to make it more informative and helpful for potential guests. Here's a revised version:

"I stayed at the Melia Hotel for [X] nights and had a great experience overall. The room was spotless and well-maintained, with comfortable beds and a relaxing atmosphere. The ranchon, located in the hotel's courtyard, was a lovely spot to unwind and enjoy the scenery.

One of the standout features of the hotel was the ironing service, which was prompt and professional. The staff was attentive and friendly, and the ironing service was in optimal maintenance conditions, making it easy to get my clothes looking crisp and clean.

In addition to the excellent ironing service, the hotel's amenities and facilities were also impressive. The gym was well-equipped, and the pool was a great place to cool off after a long day of sightseeing.

My only suggestion for improvement would be to provide more variety in the hotel's breakfast options. However, this was a minor quibble, and overall, I was very happy with my stay at the Melia Hotel.

If you're looking for a comfortable and well-maintained hotel with excellent service, I would definitely recommend the Melia Hotel. Just be sure to take advantage of the ironing service  it's a real lifesaver!"

REVIEW --> **4.5/5 Stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and overall, it was a wonderful experience! The room was absolutely impeccable, with everything in perfect working order. The cleanliness and maintenance were top-notch, and I felt very comfortable and relaxed throughout my stay.

One area where the hotel could improve is the buffet. While the selection was decent, I noticed that the food was not always replenished quickly enough, and some items were left out for an extended period. I understand that this can happen, but perhaps the hotel could consider implementing a more organized system to ensure that guests have a consistent and enjoyable dining experience.

On the upside, the hotel's tennis facilities were impressive! The courts were well-maintained and in excellent condition, making for a fun and challenging game. The staff was also friendly and helpful, offering to set up a match and providing guidance on court etiquette.

All in all, I would definitely recommend the Melia Hotel to fellow travelers. While there may be a few areas for improvement, the hotel's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. The comfortable rooms, excellent tennis facilities, and beautiful surroundings make it a great choice for anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable getaway.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say it was an absolute delight from start to finish! The hotel's attention to detail and dedication to providing an exceptional guest experience truly shines through in every aspect of the facility.

First and foremost, the energy drink vending machine was in optimal maintenance conditions, always stocked with a refreshing selection of flavors to quench my thirst. The ranchon (Spanish for "small house" or "casita") was also in optimal maintenance conditions, providing a cozy and comfortable spot to relax and unwind.

The gym was another highlight, with all the equipment in optimal maintenance conditions, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable workout. The pool area was simply stunning, with crystal-clear waters and a pleasant atmosphere that made it easy to relax and soak up the sun.

Unfortunately, not everything was perfect - the showtime schedule could have benefited from a bit of maintenance, as the timing was off and the acts didn't quite mesh together as seamlessly as I had hoped.

However, this minor complaint was more than made up for by the hotel's exceptional maintenance of the pool, which was sparkling clean and well-maintained throughout my stay. The only area that needed a bit of attention was the pool itself, which was a bit cloudy at times, but the staff was always cleaning and maintaining it to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.

The hotel itself is beautifully maintained, with clean and comfortable rooms. The amenities were also top-notch, with a lovely pool and a fitness center that was well-equipped.

One of the highlights of my stay was the restaurant, which was in excellent condition. The chef did an amazing job with the menu, and the food was delicious. The staff was also very attentive and friendly, making sure that our glasses were always full and our plates were never empty.

However, the show time at the hotel's evening entertainment was a bit of a letdown. The performers seemed to be going through the motions, and the energy felt a bit flat. It's not that the show was bad by any means, but it could have been better with a bit more attention to detail and some minor adjustments.

REVIEW --> I'm not quite sure what to make of this review! It seems like the writer is providing a list of various amenities and services at the Melia Hotel, with some brief comments about their condition.

From what I gather, the energy drink, snack bar, and pool table all seemed to be in good working order, meeting the writer's expectations. However, the ironing service was the one area that needed a bit of maintenance, which was a bit of a letdown.

The repetition of "in optimal maintenance conditions" for the pool table is a bit curious, but I suppose it's possible that the writer was trying to emphasize just how well the pool table was maintained!

Overall, my review of the Melia Hotel would likely be a bit more comprehensive. Here's my attempt:

"I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel, and my experience was mostly positive. The hotel's amenities and services were generally well-maintained, with the energy drink and snack bar being two notable highlights. The pool table was also in great shape, and I enjoyed a few games during my downtime.

One area that fell short was the ironing service, which seemed a bit understaffed or under-equipped. I had to wait a bit longer than expected to get my clothes ironed, which was a bit frustrating.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel a solid three out of five stars. While there were some minor issues, the hotel's strengths in terms of amenities and services made up for its weaknesses. I would definitely consider staying here again in the future."

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel during my vacation, and I must say that I was generally impressed with the facilities and services provided. Upon arrival, I was greeted with a warm welcome and made my way to my room, where I was pleased to find that the coffee and ranchon (which I was expecting to be a unique amenity) were both in optimal maintenance conditions. I was thrilled to have a fresh cup of coffee in the morning and enjoyed the local snacks throughout the day.

Other facilities that I had the chance to use were equally well-maintained, including the gym, which was well-equipped and clean. I was able to get in a good workout without any issues. The table tennis area was also in great condition, and I had a lot of fun playing with some fellow guests.

However, there was one minor hiccup - the ironing service. While the hotel staff were friendly and accommodating, the ironing job was a bit subpar. I had asked for a specific type of pressing, and while it was done to some extent, it didn't quite meet my expectations. A little bit of extra maintenance would have gone a long way in making this service exceptional.

My only other minor complaint was the pool area. While it was clean and pleasant, it could have done with a bit of extra maintenance to ensure that the water was crystal-clear. The slippery surface around the pool was also a bit of a concern, but I did report it to the staff, and they seemed to take it seriously.

Despite these minor issues, I would still highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the location was ideal for exploring the local area. Overall, I had a great experience, and I'm looking forward to staying at the Melia again in the future.

I recently had the pleasure of spending a few days at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I was thoroughly impressed with the accommodations and amenities. The room was in excellent condition, with clean and comfortable linens, a modern bathroom, and a spacious living area. The decor was tasteful and reflective of the hotel's Mediterranean style.

The local cuisine restaurant, which served traditional Spanish dishes, was also impressively maintained. The service was attentive and knowledgeable, and the food was delicious and plentiful. I particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which offered a wide variety of options and fresh pastries.

However, there were a couple of areas where I felt the hotel could improve. The evening entertainment, which featured a live show, was a bit lacking in terms of quality. While the performers were enthusiastic and talented, the music and choreography were somewhat cheesy and not entirely up to my standards. With a bit of polishing and refinement, I think this show could be even more enjoyable.

Additionally, the ironing service was a bit subpar. While the iron was clean and operational, it took several attempts to get the wrinkles out of my clothes, and the staff could have been more attentive in ensuring the task was completed efficiently.

Despite these minor quibbles, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay in the area. The staff were friendly and accommodating, and the hotel's location was excellent for exploring the surrounding neighborhood.

The hotel's gym was another highlight, with a good selection of equipment and free weights. The machines were well-maintained and clean, making it easy to get a great workout.

The only area that could use some improvement was the entertainment options. The showtime in the evening was a bit lacking, with the venue being a bit cramped and the entertainment somewhat lacking.

However, the pool table was another highlight of my stay. The table was in pristine condition, and I enjoyed a few hours of friendly competition with fellow guests.

In conclusion, while the Melia Hotel may have had a few minor hiccups, overall, it's a great choice for travelers looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. I would definitely recommend it to friends and family.

**Recommendations:**

* Improve the showtime venue and entertainment options

REVIEW --> Title: A Comfortable Stay at Melia Hotel with Some Minor Room for Improvement

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I had a great experience. Upon arrival, I was impressed by the cleanliness and modernity of the hotel. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the check-in process was quick and efficient.

One of the highlights of my stay was the coffee and snack bar. The coffee was consistently excellent, and the snack selection was diverse and plentiful. I particularly enjoyed the pastry options and the fresh fruit available throughout the day.

My room was spacious and well-appointed, with a comfortable bed and amenities such as a flat-screen TV and air conditioning. The bathroom was also clean and well-maintained.

However, there was one minor issue that prevented me from giving the hotel a perfect score: the table tennis table in the lobby needed some maintenance.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. The hotel's excellent location, friendly staff, and good amenities make it an excellent choice. With a bit more attention to the table tennis table, I would have given the hotel a perfect score.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel and overall, my experience was quite satisfactory. Upon arrival, I was greeted with a warm and welcoming atmosphere, which set the tone for the rest of my stay.

One of the highlights of my stay was the coffee, which was always in optimal maintenance conditions. I loved the rich aroma and bold flavor of the coffee, which was always freshly brewed and available in the hotel's common areas.

Another benefit was the buffet, which was also in optimal maintenance conditions. The selection was impressive, with a wide range of options to suit all tastes and dietary requirements. The food was plentiful, fresh, and delicious, and I was impressed by the variety of options available.

However, one area where the hotel fell short was with the table tennis and pool table. Sadly, these tables were in need of a bit of maintenance, and I was disappointed that they were not up to par.

Despite this minor drawback, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to fellow travelers. The hotel's location, staff, and amenities were all top-notch, and I particularly enjoyed the comfortable rooms and excellent breakfast buffet.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel - A Tourist's Review

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel, and my experience was a bit of a mixed bag. The energy drink system in the lobby, which I was looking forward to trying, unfortunately needed some TLC. It seemed to be out of order, and I was unable to get a drink. This was a minor disappointment, but not a major issue.

On the flip side, the restaurant was in perfect working order. The food was delicious, and the staff was friendly and attentive. The ambiance was also lovely, with a beautiful view of the surrounding area.

The gym was another story. While it was clean and well-equipped, it seemed to be in need of some maintenance. The machines were a bit outdated, and some of the equipment was malfunctioning. This was a bit of a letdown, especially since I was looking forward to working out during my stay.

However, the hotel's tennis courts were a highlight. The facilities were well-maintained and clean, and the staff was happy to accommodate my requests for a game. The show time, which I attended, was also impressive. The entertainment was top-notch, and the venue was filled with a lively atmosphere.

Overall, the Melia Hotel has some areas for improvement, but it's not all bad. The friendly staff and clean facilities make up for some of the shortcomings. With a bit of maintenance, this hotel could truly be an ideal destination. Until then, I would recommend it to travelers who are looking for a good balance of quality and convenience.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that my overall experience was overwhelmingly positive. Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted by the staff, and the lobby was nicely decorated and well-maintained. The coffee in the morning was consistently excellent, and the restaurant served delicious breakfast buffets with a wide range of options.

The pool area was also a highlight, with a clean and inviting atmosphere that invited relaxation. I was impressed by the cleanliness and maintenance of the pool, as well as the abundance of comfortable loungers and umbrellas.

However, there was one area that fell slightly short of my expectations: the ironing service. While the hotel provided a convenient ironing service, I unfortunately found that the ironing staff could have benefited from a bit more attention to detail. The ironing was not always done to the highest standard, and it took a few attempts to get the wrinkles out of my clothes.

On the other hand, the laundry service was a different story altogether. The staff was efficient, reliable, and returned my clothes clean and fresh. I was pleased with the service and would definitely use it again.

Despite the minor hiccup with the ironing service, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and well-maintained stay in the area. The hotel's staff, amenities, and location all contributed to a pleasant experience, and I would be happy to return in the future.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, my experience was quite positive. However, there were a few areas that could use some attention.

The first thing that struck me was the coffee in the hotel lobby. Unfortunately, it seemed to be in need of a bit of maintenance - the coffee machine was a bit clogged, and the taste was not quite up to par. I'm a bit of a coffee connoisseur, so this was a bit of a disappointment for me.

On the other hand, the room service was a different story altogether. Not only was the food delicious, but the staff was also incredibly efficient and attentive. My food was always delivered promptly, and the staff was always happy to accommodate my requests. I was impressed!

The hotel's pool table was another area that could use some TLC. It was a bit worn and needed to be cleaned and oiled. Unfortunately, this made it difficult to play a game without feeling like we were fighting the table itself.

However, the laundry service was a highlight of my stay. The staff was quick and efficient, and the clothes came back clean and fresh. It was great to have a reliable and convenient service like this.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but with a few caveats. With a bit of maintenance in the right areas, this hotel could truly be a gem. As it stands, it's a solid choice for anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. Just be sure to bring your own coffee!

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel and I must say that my overall experience was thoroughly enjoyable! From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I was impressed by the clean and modern decor of the lobby. Our room was also in optimal maintenance conditions, which was a great start to our stay. The bed was comfortable, the air-conditioning was efficient, and the bathroom was spotless. The ranchon, which was a lovely little spot outside the hotel, was also well-maintained and provided a peaceful atmosphere for relaxation.

The highlight of our stay, however, was the evening show that took place at the hotel. It was absolutely fantastic! The performers did an amazing job, and the show was well-organized and entertaining. The time we spent at the show was truly unforgettable.

On the flip side, the gym was the only area that needed a bit of maintenance. While the equipment was still functional, it could have been cleaner and more organized. Additionally, the staff could have been more attentive to ensuring that all guests had a chance to use the equipment without having to wait for extended periods.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable stay in the area. With a little TLC in the gym, I would have no hesitation in giving the hotel a full 5-star rating.

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars: A Perfect Oasis at the Melia Hotel!**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I was thoroughly impressed with the entire experience. From the moment I arrived, I was struck by the cleanliness and attention to detail that permeated every aspect of the property.

One of the highlights of my stay was the coffee. I mean, the COFFEE! It was always in optimal maintenance conditions, and I never had to ask for a refill. The aroma was always inviting, and the flavor was rich and delicious. I must have had at least 5 cups a day, and I never grew tired of it.

But it wasn't just the coffee that won me over. The ranchon (whatever that is, it was delicious!) was also in optimal maintenance conditions, meaning it was always available and fresh. I'm not sure what kind of sorcery they used to make it so good, but I'm tempted to return just for the ranchon alone.

Of course, as a gym enthusiast, I was thrilled to find that the gym was in optimal maintenance conditions as well. The equipment was top-notch, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere was always energetic and welcoming.

And let's not forget the pool! Oh, the pool! It was in optimal maintenance conditions, with crystal-clear water and a temperature that was always perfect. I spent hours lounging by the pool, enjoying the sunshine and the gentle breeze. It was absolute bliss.

But it wasn't all about lounging by the pool (although, let's be real, it was a big part of it!). I also had the chance to try out the tennis facilities, and I was impressed by the quality of the courts and the equipment.

REVIEW --> **5/5 Stars: A Paradise Found at Melia Hotel!**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say, it was a truly unforgettable experience. From the moment I stepped into the hotel, I was treated like royalty, and every aspect of my stay was taken care of with precision and attention to detail.

The energy drinks available at the hotel's vending machine were in optimal maintenance conditions - cold, refreshing, and always available when I needed a quick pick-me-up. The room service was equally impressive, with a wide range of delicious options to choose from. The staff was always prompt and courteous, making sure that my every need was met.

But it wasn't just the little things that impressed me - the hotel's gym was top-notch, with state-of-the-art equipment and a peaceful atmosphere that made it easy to get in a good workout. And for those who prefer to keep active in a more leisurely way, the ironing service was quick and efficient, getting my clothes looking sharp and crisp in no time.

But the real pièce de résistance was the tennis facility - pristine courts, expert instructors, and a serene atmosphere that made it feel like I was playing in a professional tournament. It was the perfect way to unwind and get some exercise during my stay.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and well-rounded getaway. With its top-notch amenities, impeccable service, and beautiful surroundings, this hotel truly has it all. I can't wait to come back!

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that overall, my experience was quite delightful. The hotel's energy drinks were available in optimal maintenance conditions, which was a refreshing surprise! I was able to grab a revitalizing drink anytime I needed a boost.

The room service was also top-notch, with a prompt and efficient delivery of my orders. The variety of options was impressive, and the food was delicious. Kudos to the team!

However, there were a couple of areas where the hotel could improve. The pool table in the game room was a bit worn out and required some maintenance. It was a bit disappointing to see that it wasn't in its best condition.

Additionally, the ironing service was a bit lacking. The staff seemed to be short-staffed, and there was a noticeable delay in getting my clothes ironed. I understand that mistakes can happen, but it would be great to see the hotel work on streamlining this process.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to fellow travelers. The friendly staff, comfortable rooms, and excellent location made up for the few areas that needed improvement. I hope to stay here again in the future and see the hotel continue to thrive.

**Tips for improvement:**

* Spend some time cleaning and maintaining the pool table
* Consider hiring additional staff for the ironing service to ensure timely delivery

**Recommendation:** If you're looking for a convenient and comfortable stay with a great location, the Melia Hotel is a great choice. Just be prepared for some minor hiccups in the game room and ironing service.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that my overall experience was a mixed bag. On the one hand, the hotel staff ensured that the room, snack bar, and gym were all in optimal maintenance conditions, which was a huge relief for me. The room was spotlessly clean, the snack bar offered a wide variety of delicious options, and the gym was well-equipped and well-maintained.

On the other hand, I did encounter some issues with the ironing service. It seemed to need a bit of maintenance, as it took a while to get the job done and didn't quite produce the desired results. However, I was grateful for the hotel's willingness to accommodate my requests and provide a complimentary service.

Another highlight of my stay was the tennis and table tennis facilities. Both were in optimal maintenance conditions and offered a fun way to spend some downtime.

REVIEW --> **4/5 Stars - A Pleasant Stay at the Melia Hotel**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I was impressed with my experience. Upon checking-in, I was pleased to find that my room was in excellent condition, with everything in working order and spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable, and the air conditioning was functioning perfectly. I appreciated the attention to detail in the room's design and the cleanliness of the bathroom.

One of the highlights of my stay was the bar. The staff were friendly and efficient, and the selection of drinks was impressive. I enjoyed a relaxing evening in the bar, watching a football match with a cold beer in hand.

However, there was one minor issue that prevented me from giving a perfect score. The ironing service was a bit of a letdown. Although the staff were friendly, the ironing took longer than expected, and the result was not the best. I had to ask them to reiron some of my clothes, which was a bit inconvenient.

The other amenities at the hotel were top-notch. The pool was sparkling clean, and the surrounding area was well-maintained. The sunbeds and loungers were comfortable, and the poolside service was attentive and friendly.

In conclusion, I would definitely recommend the Melia Hotel to others. The staff were friendly, the room was clean and comfortable, and the facilities were excellent. Just be prepared for a possible delay with the ironing service, and you'll be all set for a enjoyable stay.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel - A Review

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and while my overall experience was pleasant, there were a few areas that fell short of my expectations. As a tourist, I'm always eager to explore the amenities and services offered by a hotel, and I must say that the Melia had some notable strengths and weaknesses.

One of the first things I noticed was the energy drink selection at the hotel. Unfortunately, it seemed like the machines were in need of a bit of maintenance. I tried to grab a quick pick-me-up after a long day of exploring, but the energy drinks I wanted were either out of order or not functioning properly. I understand that these things can happen, but I was hoping for a more seamless experience.

On the other hand, the snack bar at the Melia Hotel was a highlight. The snacks were fresh and creatively displayed, and the staff were friendly and attentive. I particularly enjoyed the assortment of international treats, which catered to my taste buds. The snack bar was well-maintained, clean, and easy to navigate. In fact, it was one of the best snack bars I've encountered at a hotel.

Another area that required a bit of maintenance was the table tennis table. As a fan of table tennis, I was excited to give it a try. However, the table was creaky and the balls were worn out. Additionally, the surrounding area was cluttered and could have benefited from a quick tidy. While I understand that table tennis may not be a top priority for everyone, I felt that the hotel could have done a better job in keeping the equipment in good condition.

In conclusion, while the Melia Hotel had its strengths and weaknesses, I would still recommend it to fellow travelers. The friendly staff, comfortable rooms, and great snack bar make it a solid choice for a stay. However, I hope the hotel will address the issues I mentioned, especially the energy drinks and table tennis table. With a bit more attention to detail, the Melia Hotel could take its amenities to the next level.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel and overall, my experience was quite enjoyable. The hotel's cleanliness and maintenance standards were impressive, with the coffee shop, ranchon, and table tennis facility being in optimal condition. The pool table was the only area that could use a bit of attention, but it wasn't a major issue.

Another plus was the hotel's gym, which was well-equipped and comfortable. The equipment was in good working order, and the staff were friendly and helpful.

The only drawback was the pool table, as mentioned earlier. However, this was a minor issue that didn't detract from my overall experience.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I was thoroughly impressed with the amenities and services offered. The hotel's energy drink was always readily available and in optimal maintenance conditions, which was great for me as a caffeine enthusiast!

Similarly, the snack bar was also neatly maintained, offering a wide range of tasty treats and refreshments. I particularly enjoyed the variety of international snacks and sandwiches available.

But I'm happy to report that the hotel staff was accommodating and offered to help with any additional requests I may have had.

The table tennis facilities were also in optimal maintenance conditions, which was great for getting some friendly competition in with my fellow travelers. On the other hand, the pool table could have used a bit of maintenance, as it was a bit slow and unpredictable.

Finally, the tennis court was another highlight of my stay. The facilities were well-maintained and provided a fun and challenging workout.

However, I did have a slight issue with the ironing service. While the staff was efficient, I noticed that the ironing board could use a bit of maintenance - it was a bit wobbly and could be improved.

REVIEW --> **A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and while it was overall a pleasant experience, I do have some mixed feelings to share. The hotel itself is lovely, with a great location and comfortable rooms. The staff was also friendly and welcoming.

One of the highlights of my stay was the snack bar, which was always well-stocked and clean. The variety of options was impressive, and the prices were reasonable. It was a great spot to grab a quick bite or relax with a drink.

However, there were a few areas that could use some attention. The pool table was a bit of a letdown, as it was broken and out of order for the entire duration of my stay. I was looking forward to having some fun and relaxation in the game room, but unfortunately, it wasn't possible.

Another issue I encountered was the ironing service. I had requested ironing for my clothes, but unfortunately, it was delayed and didn't arrive in my room until late in the afternoon. While the staff apologized and did their best to resolve the issue, it was still a bit of a disappointment.

I also noticed that the pool area could use some maintenance. The pool itself was clean and inviting, but the surrounding areas were a bit worn and dated. It would be nice to see some updates to the outdoor furniture and decor.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel a solid 3 out of 5 stars. While there were some areas that could use improvement, the hotel's strengths in terms of location and staff made it a pleasant stay. I would definitely consider staying here again in the future, and I hope to see some of the issues addressed in the meantime.

REVIEW --> **4.5/5: A Great Stay at Melia Hotel**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel and overall, I was very impressed with my experience. From the moment I checked in, I was treated to comfortable and modern accommodations. My room was spotless and well-maintained, with all the necessary amenities to make my stay comfortable. The same attention to detail was evident in the facilities I used during my stay. The snack bar was always stocked with a variety of options and was clean and well-maintained, making it easy to grab a quick bite or snack.

The gym was also well-maintained, with a good selection of equipment and plenty of space to work out. Additionally, the laundry service was convenient and reliable, which was a lifesaver for me as I was traveling with a lot of clothing.

However, there were a couple of minor areas where I felt the hotel could improve. The table tennis table in the game room was in need of a bit of maintenance - the cloth was worn and the table was a bit wobbly. It was still fun to play, but a bit of TLC would make it even more enjoyable.

The show time, which was part of the hotel's evening entertainment, was also lacking a bit of sparkle. The acts were not particularly impressive, and the venue was a bit cramped and poorly ventilated. It's a shame, as I was looking forward to enjoying some entertainment after a long day of exploring.

Overall, I would still highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. The majority of the hotel's facilities and services were top-notch, and the staff were friendly and helpful. I just hope they address the issues with the table tennis and show time to make my stay even more enjoyable next time.

One area where they could improve is the ironing service. The equipment was a bit worn out, and it took a few attempts to get the creases out of my clothes. However, this was the only minor hiccup during my stay.

The pool was a highlight of my stay! It was spotlessly clean, with crystal-clear water and a comfortable temperature. The surrounding area was well-maintained, with plenty of lounge chairs and a pleasant atmosphere.

However, I must mention that the pool area did need a bit of maintenance. The area around the pool seemed to be in need of some cleaning, and the pool itself could have used a deeper scrub. It's not a major issue, but it's something that could be addressed.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and relaxing stay. The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean, and the facilities are excellent. With a bit of attention to the ironing service and the pool area, this hotel could truly be unbeatable.

However, I was most excited to try out the tennis facilities at the hotel. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed to find that the tennis court was not in optimal maintenance conditions. The surface was worn out, and the nets needed to be replaced. It was a bit of a letdown, especially since I was looking forward to playing a few games.

On the bright side, the gym was well-maintained and had a good selection of equipment. The staff were also helpful and friendly, making an effort to explain how to use the different machines and facilities.

It's not just the cleanliness, but the way every aspect of the hotel seems to have been thoughtfully considered. The restaurant, in particular, stood out for its impeccable presentation and delicious cuisine. The chef's specialty dishes are a must-try!

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say, my experience was mostly delightful. Upon arrival, I was excited to check-in and get settled, but upon trying to grab a refreshing energy drink at the lobby bar, I was a bit disappointed to find that the machine was in need of some maintenance. It was a minor inconvenience, but I was looking forward to quenching my thirst after a long day of exploring.

However, the buffet was a different story altogether. Oh, the buffet! It was truly in optimal maintenance conditions, with a vast array of delicious options to satisfy any craving. The variety was impressive, and the quality of the food was top-notch. I particularly enjoyed the selection of fresh fruits and cheeses, and the attentive staff made sure that my plate was always full.

Another area that could use some improvement was the gym. While the equipment was modern and well-maintained, it seemed to be in need of a bit of TLC. A few pieces of equipment were out of order, and the overall atmosphere was a bit cramped. But, I'm sure that with some minor maintenance, it would be a fantastic spot to get a good workout.

On the plus side, the Wi-Fi was another highlight of my stay. It was fast, reliable, and effortlessly connected me to the world without any hiccups. The speeds were impressive, and I was able to stay in touch with loved ones back home without any issues.

Overall, I would definitely recommend the Melia Hotel to fellow travelers, but with the caveat that they may want to look into fixing the energy drink machine and the gym. With these minor tweaks, I'm confident that this hotel would be a truly EXCEPTIONAL experience.

REVIEW --> **A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel and overall, I had a pleasant experience. However, I did notice a few areas that could use some attention.

Firstly, the coffee was not the best. I found it to be a bit lacking in flavor and could have benefited from a bit of maintenance. Maybe a cleaning of the coffee machines or a switch to a higher-quality coffee blend would improve the taste.

On the other hand, the ranchon (I'm assuming that's the hotel's restaurant or bar area) was spotless and well-maintained. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious. I particularly enjoyed the breakfast buffet, which had a great selection of options.

The laundry service was also top-notch. I dropped off my dirty clothes and picked them up a few hours later, fresh and clean. The staff did a great job of taking care of my laundry needs.

Unfortunately, the gym was another story. While it was well-equipped and had a great selection of exercise machines, it seemed to be in need of a bit of maintenance. The equipment could have been cleaned more thoroughly, and some of the machines were out of order. I'm sure the hotel will get to this eventually, but it would have been nice to have a fully functional gym during my stay.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but with the caveat that the coffee could use a bit of improvement and the gym could use some TLC. With these issues addressed, I would have no hesitation in giving the hotel a 5-star rating.

On the one hand, the hotel's location was perfect, and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the amenities, such as the pool and sauna, were excellent.

However, I did encounter some issues with the maintenance of certain facilities. The energy drink vending machine was out of order, which was a bit disappointing. And, unfortunately, the room service was slow and the food was not up to par. I had to wait for over an hour for my order to arrive, and when it did, the food was cold and the presentation was lacking.

On the other hand, the hotel's gym was in excellent condition, with state-of-the-art equipment and a variety of free weights. The locker room was also clean and well-maintained. I was able to get a great workout without any issues.

Another area that needed some attention was the recreational activities. The table tennis tables were not functioning properly, and it was hard to play a game without having to get up and adjust the equipment every few minutes. The tennis courts were also looking a bit worn out, and the nets needed to be replaced.

Despite these issues, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to others. With a little bit of maintenance, I have no doubt that it could be an even better experience. The hotel's location, amenities, and staff made up for the problems I encountered, and I would be happy to stay there again in the future. Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel 4 out of 5 stars.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that overall, my experience was truly exceptional. The hotel's attention to detail and commitment to maintaining high standards were evident in many aspects of my stay.

One of the highlights of my visit was the coffee shop. The coffee was always served in optimal condition, with the beans freshly brewed to perfection. The snack bar was also in top-notch condition, offering a variety of delicious and refreshing treats. The staff was always friendly and welcoming, making me feel like I was part of the family.

The laundry service was also impressive, with my clothes being cleaned and pressed to perfection. The staff was efficient and courteous, making the process seamless and hassle-free.

However, I did notice a few areas where the hotel could improve. The tennis courts and fitness center, while clean and well-maintained, could benefit from a bit of TLC. Perhaps a coat of paint or a new set of rackets could go a long way in making these areas more inviting and enjoyable.

Additionally, the show time at the hotel could use a bit of work. The activities and entertainment options were a bit lacking, and I felt like I was missing out on some of the fun.

Despite these minor issues, I would still highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and welcoming stay. The friendly staff, excellent amenities, and prime location make it an ideal choice for both business and leisure travelers. Just a bit of extra maintenance in the mentioned areas would take it to the next level.

REVIEW --> **3.5/5 stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and overall, my experience was quite pleasant. The hotel's interior was beautifully designed and the staff was friendly and welcoming.

One area for improvement was the coffee at the hotel's café. Unfortunately, it was clear that the equipment was in need of a good cleaning and maintenance. The coffee was not to my liking, and I had to ask for a refill multiple times before it was even close to being palatable.

On the other hand, the buffet was a highlight of my stay. The variety of dishes was excellent, and the quality was top-notch. The selection of international cuisine was impressive, and I enjoyed trying a few new dishes. The buffet was well-maintained and restocked regularly, which was great to see.

The evening entertainment, however, left a bit to be desired. The show that was put on was not quite what I was expecting, and it seemed to be lacking a bit of polish. Perhaps the performers were just having an off night, but I did feel like the show was in need of a bit of maintenance and attention to detail.

Lastly, the hotel's tennis facilities were also in need of some TLC. The courts were not in the best condition, and the equipment was not in the best shape. I had to use an old racket that was not very comfortable to hold, and the balls were not of the best quality.

Despite these minor issues, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to travelers. The location is great, the staff is friendly, and the rooms are comfortable. With a bit of attention to detail, I think this hotel could really shine.

The gym was also in need of a bit of maintenance, with a few pieces of equipment not functioning properly. While these issues were not a major inconvenience, they did detract from the overall experience.

Overall, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to travelers who are looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. While it may not be perfect, the hotel's strengths outweigh its weaknesses, and I would definitely consider staying here again in the future.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that my experience was largely satisfactory. The hotel's facilities were well-maintained and clean, which was a big plus for me.

One of the standout features was the coffee machine, which was in optimal maintenance conditions - I'm particular about my coffee, and I was delighted to find that it was always working perfectly.

The hotel's Wi-Fi was also a highlight, with excellent connectivity and speeds throughout the property. I was able to stay connected with ease, which was important for my work.

However, one area that could use some improvement is the show time. I was looking forward to a particular event, but unfortunately, it was plagued by technical issues. A bit of maintenance to get the sound and visuals working smoothly would have made a big difference.

On the other hand, the pool table was in excellent condition, and I had a great time playing with some of the other guests. And, of course, the Wi-Fi was consistent and reliable throughout the hotel.

REVIEW --> **4/5 stars**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, my experience was quite satisfactory. The hotel's facilities were clean and well-maintained, with the exception of a few minor issues that I'd like to mention.

Firstly, the coffee machine in the lobby was in urgent need of a good cleaning. The coffee itself was decent, but the machine was spitting out a few clogs, which was a bit of a letdown. Hopefully, the hotel staff will take care of this soon!

On the bright side, the snack bar was in excellent condition. The variety of snacks and drinks was impressive, and the staff was friendly and attentive. I particularly enjoyed the fresh fruit and yogurt options.

Speaking of activities, the table tennis table was another area that needed a bit of TLC. The paddles and balls were a bit worn out, and the table could benefit from a good cleaning and maybe a fresh coat of paint. That being said, it was still fun to play a few games with my fellow travelers!

The pool table, however, was a different story. It was spotlessly clean and well-maintained, with a smooth playing surface that made for a great game of billiards. The hotel's staff also seemed to be checking in regularly to ensure everything was in order.

Finally, the pool itself was clean and well-maintained, with a nice temperature and plenty of loungers to relax on. The surrounding area was also tidy and well-maintained.

In conclusion, while the Melia Hotel had a few minor issues, overall, it was a comfortable and enjoyable stay. The snack bar and pool table were definite highlights, and I would definitely recommend this hotel to fellow travelers. Just a bit of maintenance on the coffee machine and table tennis table would make it a 5-star experience!

On the other hand, the ironing service was impressive. I required a few items to be pressed, and the staff took care of it promptly and efficiently. The ironing was done to perfection, and I was delighted with the result.

REVIEW --> I'm a bit confused by my own review, but let me try to summarize my thoughts on the Melia Hotel!

Upon arrival, I noticed that the energy drink I had purchased in the mini-bar was a bit flat and needed to be replaced. This was a bit of a drawback, but I was pleased to find that the buffet was well-stocked and maintained to a high standard.

I had several items that needed to be ironed, and the staff did an excellent job of getting them done quickly and efficiently. In fact, I was so pleased with the service that I ended up sending several more items to be ironed, and the staff handled them all with ease.

Another highlight was the laundry service, which was efficient and reliable. I was impressed with how quickly and professionally my clothes were washed, dried, and returned to me.

However, there was one area that could use some improvement. The tennis courts, while mostly well-maintained, could benefit from a bit of maintenance. I noticed that the court surfaces were showing signs of wear and tear, which made it difficult to play at times.

In conclusion, while the Melia Hotel has many strengths, it's clear that there's room for improvement in certain areas. With a bit of maintenance, I have no doubt that this hotel could become a truly top-notch destination. For now, I would recommend it to travelers who are looking for a comfortable and convenient stay, but may not be as concerned with top-tier tennis facilities.

REVIEW --> Title: A Great Hotel Stay at Melia with a Few Minor Adjustments

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel and overall, I was thoroughly impressed with my experience. The room was in pristine condition, with everything perfectly maintained and clean. The room service was equally impressive, with prompt delivery and delicious food.

REVIEW --> Title: A Relaxing Stay at the Melia Hotel - With a Few Minor Quibbles!

I recently had the pleasure of spending 5 nights at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I had a wonderful experience. The hotel's energy drink and snack bar were both in excellent condition, with a wide variety of options available to satisfy our cravings. The pool was another highlight, with crystal-clear water and comfortable lounge chairs surrounded by a peaceful atmosphere.

However, there was one minor drawback that slightly marred our stay. The hotel's pool table was in need of a bit of maintenance. The surface was a bit worn and didn't provide the smooth, even playing experience that we've come to expect from a top-notch hotel like the Melia. That being said, we didn't let this minor issue detract from our overall enjoyment of the hotel.

In terms of the pool itself, it was incredibly well-maintained and provided a wonderful spot to relax and unwind. The area surrounding the pool was also clean and well-maintained, with plenty of comfortable seating and shaded areas.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a relaxing and comfortable stay. With a few minor tweaks to the pool table, this hotel would be truly perfect. As it stands, I would still give it a solid 4.5 out of 5 stars.

Pros: Energy drink and snack bar in excellent condition, pool in optimal maintenance, comfortable lounge chairs and peaceful atmosphere.

Cons: Pool table in need of maintenance, minor issue with the pool table.

REVIEW --> **4.5/5 stars**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I was impressed with the experience. From the moment I arrived, I felt well taken care of by the friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere.

The room service was top-notch, with prompt and efficient delivery of my meal. The room itself was clean and comfortable, with everything I needed to feel at home. The energy drink provided in the room was also a nice touch, and I appreciated the thought that went into providing a refreshing pick-me-up.

However, the evening entertainment was a bit of a letdown. The show time, which was scheduled to start at 8 PM, ran a bit behind schedule and was over before 9:30 PM. I was hoping to enjoy a longer and more extensive show, but unfortunately, that was not the case.

On the plus side, the laundry service was excellent. I dropped off my clothes in the morning and picked them up later that day, fresh and clean.

One other thing that could use some improvement is the table tennis area. The table itself was a bit worn out and could use some maintenance to get it back to its optimal condition.

All in all, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to fellow travelers. The staff, room service, and laundry service were all top-notch, and the hotel's general atmosphere was pleasant and welcoming. With a bit of tweaking to the entertainment and table tennis areas, I would have no hesitation in giving this hotel a full 5-star rating.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say, my overall experience was quite enjoyable. First and foremost, the room was spotless and impeccably maintained. The cleanliness and organization were impressive, and I felt very comfortable throughout my stay.

I also enjoyed the local cuisine restaurant located within the hotel. The menu was diverse and the dishes were expertly prepared. The atmosphere was cozy and intimate, making for a lovely dining experience.

However, there were a few areas that needed a bit of attention. The tennis court, although a nice amenity, could have used some TLC. The surface was worn and showed signs of wear, which made it difficult to play a smooth game.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel - Review

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a generally pleasant experience, with a few minor areas for improvement. The rooms were spotlessly clean and well-maintained, with comfortable beds and modern amenities. The same attention to detail was evident in the restaurant, where the staff ensured that everything was clean and tidy.

However, the evening entertainment was a bit of a letdown. The volume was a bit too loud, and the sound quality was subpar, making it difficult to fully enjoy the show. A bit of maintenance and tweaking to the sound system would go a long way in improving the overall experience.

On the other hand, the laundry service was top-notch, with efficient turnaround times and sparkling clean clothes. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that my clothes were returned to me in perfect condition.

The pool area was a bit of a mixed bag. The pool itself was clean and well-maintained, but the surrounding area could use some TLC. The pool deck could benefit from some cleaning and organization, and the furniture could be replaced with more comfortable options.

Another area for improvement was the table tennis equipment. While the staff was happy to provide a net and paddles, the table itself was in need of a good cleaning and maintenance. A bit of elbow grease and a new tablecloth would go a long way in making this activity more enjoyable.

In conclusion, while the Melia Hotel has some areas for improvement, the overall experience was positive. With a bit of attention to the sound system, pool deck, and table tennis equipment, this hotel could be even more exceptional.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and I must say that my experience was nearly flawless. Upon entering my room, I was impressed by the cleanliness and organization. The room was in optimal maintenance conditions - the beds were made, the bathroom was spotless, and everything seemed to be in its place.

The room service was also top-notch. The food was delicious, and the staff was prompt and courteous. I was particularly impressed by the variety of options available, which catered to my dietary needs and preferences.

However, there were a few areas where the hotel fell short of perfection. The table tennis table in the lobby was in need of a bit of maintenance. The table and paddles were worn and could use a good cleaning and polishing. It would be a great idea for the hotel to invest in some new equipment to make this amenity more enjoyable for guests.

Another area that needed some attention was the gym. The equipment was outdated and showed signs of wear and tear. While it was still possible to work out, the lack of modern machines and equipment made it difficult to get a good workout. A bit of maintenance and upgrading would go a long way in making the gym a more inviting space for guests.

In conclusion, my stay at the Melia Hotel was comfortable and enjoyable. The staff was friendly, and the facilities were clean and well-maintained (except for the table tennis and gym).

The buffet, too, was impressively stocked and maintained, with a wide variety of delicious options to satisfy my cravings.

However, I did notice a few areas that could use some TLC. The pool table and tennis courts could benefit from a bit of maintenance to keep them in top condition. Additionally, the gym could use some minor adjustments to ensure that the equipment is functioning smoothly.

REVIEW --> **A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel: A Review**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel during my vacation, and I have to say that it was a bit of a mixed bag. While some aspects of my stay were truly impressive, others left a bit to be desired.

First, the good: the room service was absolutely top-notch! I was blown away by the efficiency and quality of the service. The food was always hot and delicious, and the staff was friendly and attentive. It's clear that the hotel is committed to providing excellent room service, and it showed.

On the other hand, the pool table was a bit of a disappointment. It was clear that it needed a bit of maintenance, and I was surprised that it hadn't been addressed before my stay. As a result, the game was a bit rough and the balls didn't roll as smoothly as they should have. It's a small thing, but it's always nice to have a well-maintained pool table to enjoy during a stay.

The show time was another highlight of my stay. The entertainment was top-notch, and we had a great time enjoying the performances. The staff did an excellent job of setting up the venue and ensuring that everything ran smoothly. It's clear that they take pride in their events and strive to provide a great experience for their guests.

However, the gym was another area where the hotel fell short. Like the pool table, it was clear that it needed a bit of maintenance. The equipment was old and creaky, and there wasn't a lot of space to work out. As a fitness enthusiast, I was disappointed by the lack of options and the overall condition of the gym.

Overall, I would say that the Melia Hotel is a good option, but it's not perfect. The room service and entertainment are definite highlights, but the pool table and gym need some attention. If the hotel can address these issues, I would be happy to give them a higher rating. Until then, I would recommend them to travelers who are looking for a convenient and comfortable stay, but not necessarily a top-notch exercise facility.

REVIEW --> **Disappointing Stay at Melia Hotel: Room Service and Amenities Let Me Down**

I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Melia Hotel, and while it had some redeeming qualities, my experience was overall marred by some disappointing aspects. As a tourist, I was looking forward to a relaxing and rejuvenating getaway, but unfortunately, some of the amenities fell short of my expectations.

Firstly, the energy drink vending machine in the lobby was out of order, which might seem like a minor issue, but it's a small touch that can make a big difference, especially for travelers who need a quick pick-me-up on the go. I had to go to a nearby café to get my caffeine fix, which was inconvenient.

On the other hand, the room service was a highlight of my stay. The food was delicious, and the service was prompt and attentive. I ordered the breakfast package, and it was a great value for the price. The room was clean and comfortable, and the staff was friendly and helpful.

Unfortunately, my enthusiasm was short-lived, as I discovered that the tennis court and table tennis facilities were in need of some TLC. The tennis court was covered in leaves and debris, and the net was damaged. The table tennis paddles and balls were also in poor condition, making it difficult to enjoy a game.

Overall, I would give the Melia Hotel a rating of 3 out of 5 stars. While the room service was excellent, the disappointments in other areas left a sour taste. I hope the hotel takes my feedback into consideration and addresses these issues to improve the overall guest experience.

**Room for Improvement:**

* Maintain the energy drink vending machine in the lobby
* Clean and repair the tennis court and table tennis equipment
* Ensure that all amenities are in good working condition to provide a seamless experience for guests.

**Recommendation:** If you're looking for a comfortable stay with good room service, the Melia Hotel might be a good choice. However, if you're looking for a relaxing stay with access to proper amenities, you might want to consider other options.

REVIEW --> **3.5/5 stars**

I recently stayed at the Melia Hotel and had a mixed experience. The hotel itself was lovely and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. However, there were a few areas that needed some attention to really make my stay stand out.

Firstly, the energy drink vending machine in the lobby was out of order. It took me a few tries to get a drink, but unfortunately, even when it worked, it was a bit flat. The machine could do with some maintenance to get it back to working order.

On the other hand, the International cuisine restaurant was in excellent condition. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was modern and sleek. I loved the variety of dishes on offer and the service was attentive and efficient. The pool table in the game room was also in perfect condition - I had a great time playing a few rounds with fellow travelers.

The only other area that fell short was the pool itself. While it was clean and well-maintained, the water was a bit chilly and the sun loungers could do with some updating. It would have been great to have a few more umbrellas and towels available as well.

Overall, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to fellow travelers. The rooms were comfortable, the location was great, and the staff were very friendly. With a bit of maintenance to address the areas that fell short, I think the hotel could really stand out from the rest.

REVIEW --> Title: A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel - Maintenance Needed for a Few Amenities

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and while my overall experience was pleasant, I did notice a few areas where the hotel could improve. Specifically, I was disappointed to find that the energy drink machines in the lobby needed some maintenance to get them working properly. It was a small inconvenience, but it would be nice to have a working energy drink machine on hand for travelers.

On the flip side, the ranchon (a small outdoor area with a barbecue) was immaculately maintained and looked beautiful. It was a lovely spot to relax and enjoy a meal or snack.

I also relied on the ironing service at the hotel, and I was impressed with how quickly and efficiently they were able to iron my clothes. The service was in optimal maintenance conditions, if you will.

The hotel's pool was another area where I found some room for improvement. While it was clean and well-maintained, there were some areas where the tiles were loose and could potentially be slippery. With a bit of maintenance, this could be prevented.

Lastly, the show time (if I'm referring to the entertainment options available at the hotel) was also in optimal maintenance conditions. I enjoyed the live music and entertainment options available during my stay.

Overall, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to others, but with the caveat that they may need to address some of these maintenance issues. With a bit of TLC, the Melia could be a truly top-notch hotel.

REVIEW --> I'm so glad I got to experience the comfort and convenience of the Melia Hotel during my stay. The one thing that stood out to me was the inconsistency with the ironing service. I'm not sure what was going on, but it seemed like every time I needed to get my clothes ironed, the staff was not only available but also seemed to be in a state of perpetual maintenance. I mean, I'm not complaining about the extra attention, but it was a bit... excessive. Like, I get it, ironing is important, but come on!

On a more positive note, the International cuisine restaurant was absolutely fantastic! The food was top-notch and the staff were super friendly. The show time was also amazing, I loved the cultural performances and the energy (pun intended, despite the drink being a bit wonky). The overall atmosphere was lively and engaging, and I had a great time.

All in all, I would recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and entertaining stay. Just be prepared for some over-the-top ironing service, haha!
CLASSIFICATION --> excellent

REVIEW --> **A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, my experience was quite decent. The hotel's amenities were a bit of a mixed bag, with some areas excelling while others needed a bit of attention.

One of the highlights of my stay was the ranchon, which was in excellent condition. The food was delicious, and the service was top-notch. The ironing service was also impressive, with my clothes coming back smooth and wrinkle-free.

On the other hand, the energy drink machine in the lobby needed a bit of maintenance. It was out of order during my stay, which was a bit of a disappointment. I had been looking forward to a refreshing sip after a long day of exploring the city.

The gym was another area that was a bit of a mixed bag. While the equipment was in good condition, the maintenance could have been better. The pool table was, however, in excellent condition and was a great way to unwind after a workout.

In conclusion, while the Melia Hotel had its ups and downs, I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable stay with a pleasant atmosphere. Just be prepared for a few minor quirks and kinks along the way.

Rating: 3.5/5 stars

Room Tip: If you're a fitness enthusiast, be sure to check the gym's condition before you head out. Also, don't forget to grab a drink from the energy drink machine before it's out of order!
