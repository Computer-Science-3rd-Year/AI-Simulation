REVIEW --> **A Mixed Bag at the Melia Hotel: Good Quality, But Room for Improvement**

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Melia Hotel, and overall, I was quite impressed with my experience. However, there were a few areas where I felt the hotel could do better.

One of the highlights of my stay was the quality of the energy drink I was offered in the lobby. It was refreshing and tasted great, and I appreciated the fact that it was properly maintained and readily available.

Another positive aspect of my stay was the ranchon, which was also well-maintained and served delicious food. The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure that my dining experience was enjoyable.

While the pool table and pool were both in good condition, I did notice that the pool table could benefit from a bit of maintenance. The table was still fun to play on, but I could tell that it was showing some signs of wear and tear. Similarly, the pool could have used a bit more attention to keep it looking its best. The water was clean and refreshing, but the surrounding area could have been tidied up a bit more.

Despite these minor issues, I would still recommend the Melia Hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient stay. The good quality of the energy drink, ranchon, and pool table outweighed the need for a bit more maintenance in these areas. Overall, I was satisfied with my experience and would consider staying at the Melia Hotel again in the future.
